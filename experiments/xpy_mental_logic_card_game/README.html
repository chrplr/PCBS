<h1 id="mental-logic-card-guessing-game">Mental logic card guessing game</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The experiment consists of trials where three cards are presented on a row.</p>
<p>First their backs are presented, then one second later, one of the three cards is unmasked,</p>
<p>Three cards are used throughout the experiement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queen of Hearts (red back)</li>
<li>Black Spade Ace (blue back)</li>
<li>Red Diamond Ace (blue back)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that only the queen card has a red back while the two ace cards have blue backs!</p>
<p>The task is to identify the <em>middle</em> card as quickly as possible, when possible.</p>
<p>The participant must indicates his guess by pressing a key:</p>
<ul>
<li>Queen -&gt; Press ‘Q’</li>
<li>Black Spade Ace -&gt; Press ‘S’</li>
<li>Red Diamond Ace -&gt; Press ‘D’</li>
<li>Dont know -&gt; Press ‘N’</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the answer will sometimes be obvious (e.g. when the card to guess has a blue back, because only the Queen has a blue back; or when the middle card is be displayed).</p>
<p>Yet at other times, it will not be possible to decide (in that case, press ‘N’)</p>

## What you will learn (hopefully)

-  How to create visual and auditory stimuli, to program real-time experiments that record participants responses, to perform basic data processing to analyse results.

- How to use revision control software (git), and clean code methods that promote scientific reproducibility (the aim os to improve your programming skills; This lecture is of interest even for students who are not going to need to program experiments)

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of programming (numbers, strings, lists, variables, loops, conditional, functions) and of Python.
- Having installed the software described in the documentation (Python, pandas, expyriment, git, + an editor)

### Programming languages 

Mostly Python (+ pygame + expyriment + pandas) and a bit of Javascript (jsPsych) and R.

**Timetable**: During the first half of the semester, the course consists of short lectures followed by hands-on exercises; then in the second part of the semester, each student must program an experiment of his choice.

**Evaluation**: PASS/FAIL based on:

   * The realisation of a project (each student must provide a running, clean, code, corectly documented on github)

   * Attendance. We expect you to be present at each lecture (it is possible to be absent exceptionnaly, with excuse) and to send us your code at the end of each lecture  (in a zip file with PCBS_xx_your_name.zip where xx is the number of the lecture)

## Plan for the lectures

1. Creating visual stimuli with Pygame (python)

2. Programming experiments with Expyriment (python)

3. Programming *on-line* experiments with jsPsych (javascript)

4. Programming a Lexical Decision experiment (python)

5. Manipulating sound. Program an audio experiment (python)

6. More on-line experiments with jsPsych (javascript)

7. Clean code programming, Introduction to Git, Start of the project.

8-13 : Project

## Software to run experiments

Two options:

* run locally: best to control precisely the timing: duration of stimuli, synchronisation with recording equipement (e.g. EEG, MEG).

   1. psychtoolbox (Matlab) 
   2. psychopy (Python)
   3. Expyriment (Python)


* run inside an internet browser, allowing to test subjects remotely. 

   1. jsPsych
   2. PsychoJS

   See e.g. https://pavlovia.org/

## Menu of the day

* Check that you can create a python script with an editor and run it from the command line (follow the instructions from section 7.3 of 
<https://pcbs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running-python.html>)


* Create Visual Stimuli with Pygame

Go to chapter [Creating Stimuli](https://pcbs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stimulus-creation.html#creating-stimuli) of  <https://pcbs.rtfd.io>

Starting from the `square.py` script, you will program:

1. Troxler effect 
2. Kanizsa Square
3. Herman grid
4. Ebbinghaus-Tichener illusion

**Content**: how to create visual and auditory stimuli, program real-time experiments that record participants responses, perform basic data processing to analyse results... how to use revision control software (git), and clean code methods that promote scientific reproducibility.

**Aim**: to improve your programming skills. This lecture is of interest even for students who are not going to need to program experiments 

---

**Prerequisites**:

- basic knowledge of programming (numbers, strings, lists, variables, loops, conditional, functions) and of Python.
- having installed the software described in the documentation (Python, pandas, expyriment, git, + an editor)

**Programming languages**: mostly Python (+ pygame + expyriment + pandas) and Javascript (jsPsych).

---

**Timetable**: During the first half of the semester, the course consists of short lectures followed by hands-on exercises; then in the second part of the semester, each student must program an experiment of his choice.

**Evaluation**: PASS/FAIL based on:

    * the realisation of a project (each student must provide a running, clean, code, corectly documented on github)

    * Attendance: you must be present at each lecture (it is possible to be absent exceptionnaly, with excuse) and send us your code at the end of each lecture  (in a zip file with you name and the number of the lecture)

# Plan for the lectures

1. Creating visual stimuli with Pygame (python)

2. Programming experiments with Expyriment (python)

3. Programming *on-line* experiments with jsPsych (javascript)

4. Programming a Lexical Decision experiment (python)

5. Manipulating sound. Program an audio experiment (python)

6. More on-line exepriments with jsPsych (javascript)

7. Clean code programming, Introduction to Git, Start of the project.

8-13 : Project

# Software to run experiments

Two options:

* run locally: best to control precisely the timing: duration of stimuli, synchronisation with recording equipement (e.g. EEG, MEG).

   1. psychtoolbox (Matlab) 
   2. psychopy (Python)
   3. Expyriment (Python)


* run inside an internet browser, allowing to test subjects remotely. 

   1. jsPsych
   2. PsychoJS

## Creating Visual Stimuli with Pygame

Go to chapter [Creating Stimuli](https://pcbs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stimulus-creation.html#creating-stimuli) of  https://pcbs.readthedocs.io:

(Note: If you do not know how to run Python, check out <https://pcbs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running-python.html>)

Terminal cheat sheet reminder
========================================================

- Bash commands to navigate directories

  + Print Working Directory. Print the path of the current directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  pwd
  ```

  + List all files of the current directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  ls folder
  ```

  + Moving into folder1 and subfolder2 at once. 
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd folder1/subfolder2
  ```
  
  + Moving out of a directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ..
  ```
  
  + Going back and forth in the directory tree
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ../../folder1/subfolder1
  ```
  
  + Going back to the root directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ~
  ```
  
- "**Tab**" to use the auto-completion

- **Ctrl + C** to stop a program execution

- Many more bash commands to use...

Functions intro 1/2
========================================================

>  - A function is a block of instructions that is given a name.

>  - If you call a function, you execute the code written in that function
>     ```{python function_example, echo =TRUE}
>     #  definition of a function named 'one_two'
>     def one_two():
>       print(1)
>       print(2)
>       print('...')

>     one_two() # function calls 1
>     one_two() # function calls 2
>     ```




Functions intro 2/2
========================================================

>  - Calling a function is like substituting the function call by its body.

>  - If you do not call the function, it will never be executed.

>  - Run this code in http://pythontutor.com/
>     ```{python lorem_ipsum, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
>     #  definition of a function named 'one_two'
>     def lorem_ipsum():
>       print("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.")
>       print(" Sed non risus.")
        print("Suspendisse lectus tortor, dignissim sit amet, adipiscing nec, ultricies sed, dolor")
>       print('...')

>     lorem_ipsum() # function calls 1
>     lorem_ipsum() # function calls 2
>     ```

>  - What, in your opinion, is the interest of functions?   


Usefulness of functions
========================================================



>  - Using functions avoids to duplicate code (i.e. by cutting and pasting). This facilitates the modification and correction of a program (errors are at a single place!)

>  - Using functions typically serves to make the code more readable (and maybe shorter).



Definitions first ! 
========================================================
>  - Function have a syntax You define a function using **def name():**
>     + **def **
>     + **name + ()** as for the built-in functions (ex: len(string))
>     + **:** Never forget the **:**

>  - Functions must be defined before they are called
>     ```{python function_example2, echo =TRUE, eval=FALSE, error=TRUE}
>     one_two() # function calls 1
>     one_two() # function calls 2

>     def one_two():
>       print(1)
>       print(2)
>       print('...')
>     ```
>     NameError: name 'one_two' is not defined 




>  - Remarks:
>     + A given script can contain several function definitions.
>     + As a convention, all functions definitions must be at the beginning of the script.


Arguments
========================================================

>  - You can also give an input to your function. This input is called a parameter
>     ```{python, echo =TRUE}
>     def hello(name):
>         print('Hello, ' + name)

>     hello('Alice')
>     hello('Bob')
>     ```

>  - During the call hello('Alice'), the argument Alice is stored in the variable name.


>  - Run it in http://pythontutor.com/

>  - Note: the variable name is created only during the execution of the function hello() (it is local to hello())


Multiple arguments
========================================================

>  - If you can pass one, you can pass two or 10
>     ```{python, echo =TRUE}
>     def print_if_divisible(n, div):
>       if (n % div == 0):
>         print(n, ' is a divisible by ', div)

>     print_if_divisible(10, 5)
>     print_if_divisible(11, 5)
>     ```

>  - Exercise: using the above function, write a script to find the divisors of 10, 15, 27, 33, 64, 100

Return values 1/3
========================================================

>  - The functions we have seen so far executed actions.

>  - A function can also return the result(s) of a computation
>     ```{python eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
>     def func(x):
>       y = 2 * x + 1
>       return y

>     print(func(0.0))
>     print(func(1.0))
>     print(func(2.5))
    
>     ```

Return values 2/3
========================================================

```{python, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
def func(x):
  y = 2 * x + 1
  return y
# compute the values of func for x in [-10, _9, -8, ..., 8, 9, 10] 
xs = range(-10, 11)
values = []
for x in xs:
  values.append(func(x))
      
# display them on a graphics
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(xs, values)
plt.show()
```

Return values 3/3
========================================================

```{python, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
def func(x):
  y = 2 * x + 1
  return y
# compute the values of func for x in [-10, _9, -8, ..., 8, 9, 10] 
xs = range(-10, 11)
values = []
for x in xs:
  values.append(func(x))
      
# display them on a graphics
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(xs, values)
plt.show()
```



Boolean Functions
========================================================

Boolean functions return True or False

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def is_divisible(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0):
        result = True
    else:
        result = False

    return result

print(is_divisible(10, 5))
```

-> Question: how could one "simplify" (shorten) the function is_divisible ?
    

Returning "complex" objects
========================================================

>  - A function can return a tuple, a list, a dictionary, ...
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     def f(x): 
>         y1 = x + 1 
>         y2 = x * 3 
>         y3 = x ** 2 + 3 
>         return (y1, y2, y3)

>     a,b,c =f(2.0)
>     print(a,b,c)
>     ```

>  - Default values for arguments. You can insert a parameter by default if none are passed.

>  - It is possible to provide defaults values for arguments.
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     def message(name, msg='Hello'):
>         print(msg + ' ' + name + '!')

>     message("Anna")
>     message("Anna", "Gooodbye")
>     ```
  
Use of position or keyword
========================================================

  - In a function call, parameters are typically assigned to arguments based either on the position or on their names.

```{python, echo=TRUE} 
def f(a, b):
  print('a=', a)
  print('b=', b)

f(1 ,2)
f(2, 1)
f(b=2, a=1)   # but one can also use the names of arguments
```

Methods vs Functions
========================================================

- Methods are pretty much like functions

- Each data type has its own set of methods

- For example the **list** data type has:
  + **append()**
  + **sort()**
  + **index()**
  + **reverse()**
  + ...
  
- Contrary to functions, methods are called on a value (lists, dictionaries, sets ... )

- Example of the difference between method and function 
```{python, echo=TRUE}
def appending(list1,new_element):
  list1[-1] = new_element
  return list1

element = "g"
myList = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e" ]
myList.append(element) # method
print(myList)
print(appending(myList,element)) # function
```


Scope of variables 1/2
========================================================

>  - Try the following code in http://pythontutor.com/
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     name = 'chris'

>     def hello(name):
>         print('Hello, ' + name)

>     print(name)
>     hello('Alice')
>     hello('Bob')
>     print(name)
>     ```

>  - Name is used for two different variables with the same name. It's possible (and confusing) because they don't have the same scope

Scope of variables 2/2
========================================================

>  - **local variables** : Arguments or variables defined inside the body of a function only exist while the function is executed. They are destroyed and the associated memory is freed.

>  - **non-local variables** : Variables that have been created in the environment where the variable was called. functions can access them (if they are not shadowed by a local variable)

>  - Yet, this is bad practice and must be avoided except in a few cases.

>  - Why ? Because one should be able to understand what a function is going to do only based on its call.

>  - Read section ""Local and Global Scope"" in Automate the Boring stuff : https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/
      

functions can call other functions
========================================================

Note that functions can call each other.

```{python eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
def func1():
  print(1)
    
def func2():
  func1()
  print(2)
  func1()
    
func2()
```
-> Predict the output of this script.

functions can call other functions
========================================================

Note that functions can call each other.

```{python echo=TRUE}
def func1():
  print(1)

def func2():
  func1()
  print(2)
  func1()

func2()
```  
  
Recursive functions 
========================================================

Recursive functions are function that contains calls to themselves:

For example:
```{python echo=TRUE}
def fact(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * fact(n - 1)
```

Modules
========================================================

>  - We saw in the 3rd class that modules can let you access to function via the command:
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     import random
>     ```

>  - But you can create your own module with your own functions. Just be sure to not use a name already used by the standard Library of Python

>  - Functions defined in a file myfunc.py in the current folder can be called from another python script.
>     ```{python eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
>     ### file "mymodule.py"
>     def hello(name):
>       print("Hello ", name, "!")
    
>     ### file "myscript.py"
>     import mymodule
    
>     mymodule.hello("Chris")
>     ```    
  
>  - modules (aka libraries) allow to reuse functions and have a clearer script.
>  - Reminder Python comes with many modules, e.g. random, math, os.



if name == 'main'
========================================================

- Many scripts will contain a series of functions and then the line

```{python if_main, echo =TRUE, eval=FALSE}
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

- It will act differently if the script is the main script of if it is imported by another script

- The condition is true only if the script is executed as a python script.

- The functions defined before the **if __name__ == '__main__':** can be reused with import script

- Why does it work like that? If you are creating a library or a module, you might want to have some configuration tests or settings. At the same time you want it to be used as a module by others so that they only need the functions.


Functions vs Procedures
========================================================

>  - A pure function is returning exactly the same value for the same parameter and has no side effect.
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     def addition(a,b):
>       return a+b
>     x=addition(1,2)
>     print(x)
>     ```

>  - A function return a value and calculate the value based on the input.
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     a=1
>     def addition(b):
>       return a+b
>     x=addition(2)
>     print(x)
>     ```

>  - A procedure execute commands
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     def addition(a,b):
>       print(a+b)
>     addition(1,2)
>     ```

Exercises:
========================================================


1- Define a function with two arguments --- a string msg and a number nrepetitions --- that prints msg, nrepetition times.

2- Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit and write a function that converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and another one that converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit

3- Define a function is_prime(x) which returns True if x is a prime number, else False. Use it to list all prime numbers below 1000.

4- Two taxis companies propose different pricing schemes: Company A charges 4.80€ plus 1.15€ by km traveled. Company B charges 3.20€ plus 1.20€ by km traveled. Write a first function which, given a distance, returns the costs of both companies, and a second function that returns 'company A' and 'company B', the cheapest company for a given distance.

5- Write a function are_anagrams(word1, word2) that tests if two words are anagrams, that is contain the same letters in different orders.

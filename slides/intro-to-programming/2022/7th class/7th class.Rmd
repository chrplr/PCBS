- Bash commands to navigate directories

  + Print Working Directory. Print the path of the current directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  pwd
  ```

  + List all files of the current directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  ls folder
  ```

  + Moving into folder1 and subfolder2 at once. 
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd folder1/subfolder2
  ```
  
  + Moving out of a directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ..
  ```
  
  + Going back and forth in the directory tree
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ../../folder1/subfolder1
  ```
  
  + Going back to the root directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ~
  ```
  
- "**Tab**" to use the auto-completion

- **Ctrl + C** to stop a program execution

- Many more bash commands to use...

Today
========================================================

  - csv
  
  - Date format
  
  - downloading
  

CSV
========================================================

> - Comma-separated-value (CSV) is a text file that uses comma to delimit data entries.

> - .csv is a pretty simple and basic format that is often use when data needs to be compatible with many different programs and applications

> - csv files can be open by any text editors, spreadsheet like Excel and many other programs.

> - Data bases for example, very often support csv as an export format.

> - example:
>    ```{bash, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
>    Name,Email,Phone,Address
>    John Doe,johndoe@example.com,123-456-7890,123 Fake Street
>    Michel Dupont,michel.dupont@test.com,098-765-4321,321 Ghost Avenue
>    ```


Date format 1/3
========================================================  

> - Datetime module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html

> - Module that supplies classes for manipulating dates and times

> - Datetime module has a lot of different objects for example:
>   * **timedelta** object represents a duration, the difference between two dates or times.
>   * **date** object represents a date (year, month and day) in a calendar
>   * **datetime** object is a single object containing all the information from a date object and a time object
>   * **time** object represents a (local) time of day, independent of any particular day

> - Example 1
>   ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>   from datetime import *
>   date1 = date(2022,11,8)
>   date2 = date(2022,12,24)
>   difference = date2 - date1
>   print(difference , "Before Christmas")
>   print(type(date1))
>   print(type(difference))
>   ```



Date format 2/3
========================================================

- Example 2

```{python, echo=TRUE}
from datetime import *

time = datetime.now()
print(time)

time2 = datetime.now()
print(time2)

if time > time2:
  print("time is posterior to time2")
elif time2 > time:
  print("time2 is posterior to time")
```


Date format 3/3
========================================================

- Example 3

```{python, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
from datetime import *

time = datetime(2022,11,8,14,30,10)
print(time)

time2 = date(2022,11,8)
print(time2)


if time > time2:
  print("time is posterior to time2")
elif time2 > time:
  print("time2 is posterior to time")
elif time == time2:
    print("They are the same date")
```

 \#\# TypeError: can't compare datetime.datetime to datetime.date
 
 
Exercise
======================================================== 

- We are gonna work today on the open data regarding location of cameras / video protection in Paris (until 2018)

- From the government website https://www.data.gouv.fr download the .ods file here: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/c2f25a7d-c916-45b8-ba23-f658c63bae6b

- Save the file in .csv

- Exercise 1: Return the number of cameras in Paris

- Exercise 2: Print all information about cameras in the 5th arrondissement

- Exercise 3: Number of cameras in each arrondissement

- Exercise 4: Print arrondissement with the highest number of cameras

- Exercise 5: Date of first camera installed in Paris

Terminal cheat sheet reminder
========================================================

- Bash commands to navigate directories

  + Print Working Directory. Print the path of the current directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  pwd
  ```

  + List all files of the current directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  ls folder
  ```

  + Moving into folder1 and subfolder2 at once. 
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd folder1/subfolder2
  ```
  
  + Moving out of a directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ..
  ```
  
  + Going back and forth in the directory tree
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ../../folder1/subfolder1
  ```
  
  + Going back to the root directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ~
  ```
  
- "**Tab**" to use the auto-completion

- **Ctrl + C** to stop a program execution

- Many more bash commands to use...

Today
========================================================

- More on functions:

- Building abstraction with :
  + Recursive functions
  + High order functions

- Exercises


Clarification 1 1/2
========================================================

- Breaking a loop is possible. For example when the rest of a loop is useless
```{python break, echo =TRUE}
# Checking if a number is primitive
N = 72239
for i in range(2, 300):
  if N % i == 0:
    print(i)
    break 
```

- Other example
```{python break2, echo =TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Checking a password
passwd = 'sesame'

while True:
  code = input('Password? ')
  if code == passwd:
    break
  else:
    print('invalid password')

print("You are in!")
```


Clarification 1 2/2
========================================================

- The keyword continue is also very useful to pass the current iteration
```{python continue, echo =TRUE}
for i in range(0,10):
  if i == 5:
    continue
  print(i)
```


Clarification 2
========================================================

- Many scripts will contain a series of functions and then the line

```{python if_main, echo =TRUE, eval=FALSE}
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

- It will act differently if the script is the main script of if it is imported by another script

- The condition is true only if the script is executed as a python script.

- The functions defined before the **if __name__ == '__main__':** can be reused with import script

- Why does it work like that? If you are creating a library or a module, you might want to have some configuration tests or settings. At the same time you want it to be used as a module by others so that they only need the functions.


More on functions 1/4
========================================================

> - Information can be passed into a function with what is called Parameters or Arguments
>   ```{python arguments, echo =TRUE}
>   def my_function(parameter1, parameter2):
>     print("Hello, my name is", parameter1, "and I'm", parameter2,"years old")

>   argument1 = "Bob"
>   argument2 = 30
>   my_function(argument1, argument2)
>   ```

> - Parameter is in the definition of a function and Argument refer to the information passed in the call of the function


More on functions 2/4
========================================================

- Arbitrary Argument or \*args:
```{python arg, echo =TRUE}
def my_function(*parameter):
  print("Hello, my name is", parameter[1])

argument1 = "Bob"
argument2 = "Linda"
argument3 = "Peter" 
argument4 = "Nancy"
my_function(argument1, argument2, argument3, argument4)
my_function(argument2, argument3)
```

- If you don't know how many arguments you'll have, you can use a \* before the parameter name in the definition of your function.



More on functions 3/4
========================================================

- Keyword argument. Remember that you can do
```{python, echo=TRUE} 
def f(a, b):
  print('a=', a)
  print('b=', b)

f(1 ,2)
f(2, 1)
f(b=2, a=1)   # but one can also use the names of arguments
f(b=1, a=2)
```

- It is called Keyword arguments. That way you don't need to put arguments in the correct order.


More on functions 4/4
========================================================

> - If you can pass on to a function, an unknown number or arguments (with \*args) in unordered manner (with Keyword arguments), you have Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, \*\*kwargs
>   ```{python kwarg, echo =TRUE}
>   def my_function(**parameter):
>     print("Hello, my name is", parameter["name1"], "and not", parameter["name3"])

>   argument1 = "Bob"
>   argument2 = "Linda"
>   argument3 = "Peter" 
>   argument4 = "Nancy"
>   my_function(name1= argument1, name2= argument2, name3= argument3)
>   my_function(name1= argument2, name2= argument3, name3= argument4)
>   ```


Summary on function
========================================================

  - A function is a block of instructions that is given a name
  
  - Functions must be defined before they are called (so usually all functions are defined before any code)

  - Using functions avoids to duplicate code (i.e. copy and paste code)

  - Using functions typically serves to make the code more readable (and maybe shorter)

  - If you do not call the function, it will never be executed
  
  - A function can:
    + have an input (one or several arguments of any kind of data types) 
    + inputs can have default value
    + have an output (return one or several data) but not necessarily (procedure)
    + they can interact with outside variables or only depend on its arguments (pure function)
    
  - Variables defined in a function stay only in the scope of the function
  
  - One good practice is to place functions in an external modules such as the module in the standard library 
  
  - Functions can call functions
  
  - Functions can call themselves...



Building abstraction
========================================================

- In programming, we control the intellectual complexity of our programs by building abstractions that hide details when appropriate
  + That is exactly what you do when you use function like **len()**
  + That is exactly what you do when you build your own functions/modules

- This allows you to chunk compound operations as conceptual units, give them a name and manipulate them

- In this class, you will explore two other means to build a high level of abstractions with functions: recursive functions and higher-order functions.
  
  
  
Recursive function
========================================================


>  - Remember what I said about recursive functions last time ?

>  - Recursion is a function calling itself
  
>  - That has a termination condition
  
>  - And an increment statement



Recursive function example 1
========================================================

  - A concrete example of recursive implementation, yet bad

![](/home/dbhenri/Documents/Cours python/PCBS/slides/intro-to-programming/2022/5th class/recursivity.png)

Recursive function example 2
========================================================

  - Recursion and lists: add every number in list with for loops
  
```{python, echo =TRUE}
## With a loop for

def sum(list):
  sum = 0
  
  # Add every number in the list.
  for i in range(0, len(list)):
    sum = sum + list[i]
        
  # Return the sum.
  return sum

print(sum([5,7,3,8,10]))
```

Recursive function example 3
========================================================

  - Recursion and lists: with recursion
  
```{python, echo =TRUE}
def sum(list):
  if len(list)==1:
    return list[0]
  else:
    return list[0] + sum(list[1:])

print(sum([5,7,3,8,10]))
```
  

Recursive function example 4.1
========================================================

  - Factorial with for loops

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def calcFactorial(number):
    factorial = 1
    
    for count in range (1, number):
        factorial = factorial*count
            
    factorial = factorial*number
    return factorial
  
print(calcFactorial(5))
```

Recursive function example 4.2
========================================================

  - Factorial with for recursion
  
```{python, echo =TRUE}
def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else :
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  
print(factorial(5))
```

- But it has limitations. Everytime a function calls itself it allocates memory for that new call of the function. So you might easily run into an error. Python stops the function calls after a depth of 1000 calls. 
      RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

- You don't have that problem with the for loop


Recursive function example 4.3
========================================================

```{python, eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE}

def calcFactorial(number):
    factorial = 1
    
    for count in range (1, number):
        factorial = factorial*count
            
    factorial = factorial*number
    return factorial
  
print(calcFactorial(3000))


def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else :
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  
print(factorial(1000))
```



Recursive function example 4.4
========================================================

```{python,eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)

def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else :
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  
print(factorial(1000))
```
- But keep in mind that it has limitations and recursion is very suited for certain problems but not for all

Exercises on recursion
========================================================

1 - Write a recursive function to reverse a list

2 - Write a recursive function to generate all permutations of a list of values

3 - Write a script that returns the pathnames of all the files contained inside a directory (at any depth of the hierarchy). You will need to use os.listdir() and os.path.isdir().


Higher-order functions : Intro
========================================================

  - A higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:

    + takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. functions are assigned as variable)
  
    + returns a function as its result
  
  - High order function had a new layer of complexity in term of abstraction

Application of high order function 1
========================================================

  - Example of Function as an arguments
  
```{python, echo = TRUE} 
# Python program to illustrate functions 
# can be passed as arguments to other functions 
def shout(text): 
    return text.upper() 
    
def whisper(text): 
    return text.lower() 
    
def greet(function): 
    # storing the function in a variable 
    greeting = function("Hi, I am created by a function \
    passed as an argument.") 
    print(greeting)  
 
  
greet(shout) 
greet(whisper)
```


Application of high order function 2  1/4
========================================================

  - Consider these examples:
```{python, echo=TRUE}
def sum_naturals(n):
  total, k = 0, 1
  while k <= n:
    total, k = total + k, k + 1
  return total
sum_naturals(4)
```  

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def sum_cubes(n):
  total, k = 0, 1
  while k <= n:
    total, k = total + pow(k, 3), k + 1
  return total
sum_cubes(4)
```

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def pi_sum(n):
  total, k = 0, 1
  while k <= n:
    total, k = total + 8 / (k * (k + 2)), k + 4
  return total
pi_sum(100)
```
  
  - These functions have lots of things in common except for the names and the calculation of k
  
  
Application of high order function 2  2/4
======================================================== 

  - The pattern is 
  
```{python, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}  
def <name>(n):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + <term>(k), <next>(k)
    return total
```

  - The presence of this kind of pattern is an evidence for a new level or abstraction that can be brought
  
  - for example in putting <term> and <next> as arguments

Application of high order function 2  2/4
======================================================== 

  - The pattern is the following
  
```{python, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}  
def <name>(n):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + <term>(k), <next>(k)
    return total
```

  - The presence of this kind of pattern is an evidence for a new level or abstraction that can be brought
  
  - In that case in putting <term> and <next> as arguments
```{python, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}  
#changing the name
def summation(n, term, next):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + term(k), next(k)
        return total
```


Application of high order function 2  3/4
========================================================

```{python, echo = TRUE}  
def summation(n, term, next):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + term(k), next(k)
        return total

def cube(k):
  return pow(k,3)

def successor(k):
  return k + 1

def sum_cubes(n):
  return summation(n,cube,successor)

sum_cubes(3)

```


Application of high order function 2  4/4
========================================================

```{python, echo = TRUE}  
def summation(n, term, next):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + term(k), next(k)
        return total

def identity(k):
  return k

def successor(k):
  return k + 1

def sum_naturals(n):
  return summation(n, identity, successor)

sum_naturals(3)
```

Exercise on pdb 1/4
========================================================

- Use my exercise correction from last week on the cameras and:
  + 1 execute line by line the program using pdb
  + 2 print argument(s) of all function and check its type
  + 3 set breakpoints right before every return statement of a function


Exercise on pdb 2/4
========================================================

- Use my exercise correction from last week on the cameras and:
  + 1 log every argument/parameter sent to a function
  + 2 log every variable in a return statement
  
  
Exercise on pdb 3/4
======================================================== 

  - Debug the following adding program:
```{python, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
print('Enter the first number to add:')
first = input()
print('Enter the second number to add:')
second = input()
print('Enter the third number to add:')
third = input()
print('The sum is ' + first + second + third)
```


Exercise on pdb 4/4
======================================================== 

- Debug the following coin toss program:
```{python, echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
import random
guess = ''
while guess not in ('heads', 'tails'):
    print('Guess the coin toss! Enter heads or tails:')
    guess = input()
toss = random.randint(0, 1) # 0 is tails, 1 is heads
if toss == guess:
    print('You got it!')
else:
    print('Nope! Guess again!')
    guesss = input()
    if toss == guess:
        print('You got it!')
    else:
        print('Nope. You are really bad at this game.')
```


Exercise 1
========================================================

- Write a program that asks for the first name, last name, age and date of birth of a user. Then create one or several functions that perform input validation 

- Check that the age is a valid number, 

- Check that the first name and last name are only letters

- Check that the date of birth is in the valid format dd/mm/yyy and is coherent with the their age

- Otherwise, ask again the invalid data


Exercise 2 
========================================================

- Write a Python program to create a Caesar cipher https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher. 
- With one function to encrypt the text with a shift 
- And one to decrypt the text using the same shift.
- The program should consider uppercase and lower case
- Hint: check the function ord()

Exercise 3 
========================================================

- Write a program that compares two strings or texts and checks 1- the percentage of similar letters 2- the percentage of similar words


Exercise 4
========================================================

- Write a program that try to perform a Brute-force attack:
- using these characters "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890-_.+!:;?,"
- Ask the user a password (1 - 15 character)
- Then write a program that try every possible combination of a a set of character
- Hint: check itertools module

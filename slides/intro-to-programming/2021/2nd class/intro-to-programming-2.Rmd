Reminder
========================================================

 
  - Bash commands to navigate directories
   
  - Useful commands:

    + **pwd**     Print Working Directory. Print the path of of the current directory
    
    + **ls /folder**        list all files of the current directory
    
    + **cd /folder1/folder2**     moving into folder1 and folder2 at once. 
    
    + **cd ..**        moving out of a directory 
  
  - "Tab" to use the auto-completion
    
  - Many more bash commands to use...


So far
========================================================

  - Python

  - Variables

  - Data types:
    + integer
    + float
    + string
    + boolean
  
  - If and For loops:
    + syntax
    + indentation

Today
========================================================


- While loop

- Other python data types for collections of data type

  + list

  + set

  + tuple

  + dictionary
  
- Random numbers and number choices
  
- Excercices


While loop 1/3
========================================================

- **While** loop will keep looping all over again an ending instruction is met.

- As the **for** loop incorporate a specified number of execution, the **while** loop is best suited for unknown or very large number of loop iterations.

- As for **if** and **for**, **while** has a syntax and need indentation for the following lines to be included in the process

- The two key features of a while loop are:
  + the output condition 
  
  + the increment statement



While loop 2/3
========================================================

- Example:

```{python, echo=TRUE}
i = 1
while i < 4: #  output condition
  print(i)
  i += 1     # increment statement
````

  
```{python, echo=TRUE}
## Which is technically the same as
for i in range(1,4):
  print(i)
```


While loop 3/3
========================================================

- **While** loop will test if the output condition is True and if not it will execute the code and execute the increment statement
  
- If one of those two conditions are not correctly specified you'll encounter an error or an infinite loop...
  
        i = 1
        while i < 6: #  output condition
          print(i)
          
        while i != 6:
          print(i)
          x += 2



Lists 1/3
========================================================

  - A list is a collection of related objects
  
  - It's declared with brackets [] with a comma between two objects
  
```{python , echo=TRUE}
Years_France_won_worldcup = [1998, 2018]
print(Years_France_won_worldcup)

dog_breeds = ["golden", "corgi", "Bulldog", "Husky", "Beagle"]
dog_breeds2 = ["golden" "corgi" "Bulldog" "Husky" "Beagle"]
print(dog_breeds)
print(dog_breeds2)

random_data_type_collection = [ 1, True, "Cats", 3.14]
print(random_data_type_collection)
```

Lists 2/3
========================================================

  - Access element in a list through its index which is the same to access characters in a string as in a list
```{python , echo=TRUE}
prog_language = ["python", "R", "C", "java", "Go", "Rust"]
print(prog_language[0])
print(prog_language[-1])
```  

```{python , echo=TRUE}
programming_language = "python"
print(programming_language[0])
```  

Lists 3/3
========================================================

  - some functions
    + append()
    + remove()
    + pop()
    + sort()
    + len()
```{python , echo=TRUE}
prog_language = ["python", "R", "C", "java", "Go", "Rust"]
prog_language.append("html")
prog_language.append("PHP")
print(prog_language)

prog_language.remove("html")

len(prog_language)

prog_language.sort()
print(prog_language)

```  
    

Tuples 1/3
========================================================

  - Very similar to Lists and is used for data collection
  
  - Declared with () instead of square bracket
  
``````{python, echo=TRUE}
date_covid_shots = ("21-04-15", "21-05-18", "21-09-20")

print(type(date_covid_shots)) # type function is very important

print(date_covid_shots[1])  # Accessible as list with index with []
print(len(date_covid_shots))
``````
  
Tuples 2/3
========================================================

  - In contrast to lists, they are immutable and can't be modified.
    
        date_covid_shots = ("21-04-15", "21-05-18", "21-09-20")
        date_covid_shots.append("21-09-27")
  
  - You can't change the order of items neither modify the value of an item

  - Tuples are best suited when you need ordered lists that would never change
    + If you want to code a calendar :  days and years can be coded as tuples as they would not change but are ordered.

Tuples 3/3
========================================================
  
  - Note that you could combine lists and tuples
``````{python, echo=TRUE}
Cocktails = [("Cosmo","5€"),("Daiquiri","7€"),("B52","6€")]
Cocktails.append(("Mojito","7€"))

print(Cocktails)
``````

  - NB: you can also declare a tuple that way
`````{python, echo = TRUE}
date_covid_shots = tuple(["21-04-15", "21-05-18", "21-09-20"])
# in this line you transform a list into a tuple
print(type(date_covid_shots))
`````
  

Sets
========================================================

  - Very close to lists but are unordered unindexed and do not allow duplicate value BUT are mutable
  
  - Declared with {}
  
`````{python, echo = TRUE}
fruit_I_like = {"apple", "pineapple", "peach"}
print(type(fruit_I_like))
print(fruit_I_like)

fruit_I_like.add("strawberry")
"strawberry" in fruit_I_like # Check if a fruit is in my set
fruit_I_like.remove("apple")
print(fruit_I_like)
`````
  - But can't add/remove items in a set or access to item with index. Following instructions should throw an error
  
        fruit_I_like[0]
        fruit_I_like.append("banana")
        
      

Dictionaries 1/
========================================================

  - Data structure that uses data in key-value pairs.
  
  - Each items of a dictionary is a key-value pair
  
  - Each key has to be unique
  
  - Declared in a very specific way

        my_dictionary = { "key1" : value1, "key2": value2 ...}
  
`````{python, echo = TRUE}
PCBS = {
  "Name" : "PCBS",
  "Teacher" : "Christophe Pallier",
  "Teacher assistant1" : "Cedric",
  "Teacher assistant2" : "Henri",
  "Day": "Tuesday",
  "Duration" : 3,
  "Mandatory" : False}
  
print(PCBS)
`````
  
  
Dictionaries 2/3 Create a Dictionary  
========================================================

  - You have several methods to create a dictionary:
    
    
  - Examples
`````{python, echo = TRUE}
PCBS = {}
PCBS["Name"] = "PCBS"
PCBS["Teacher"] = "Christophe Pallier"
PCBS["Teacher assistant1"] = "Cedric"
PCBS["Teacher assistant2"] = "Henri"
PCBS["Day"] = "Tuesday"
PCBS["Duration"] = 3
PCBS["Mandatory"] = False 
print(PCBS)
`````  
  - Which is exactly the same as
`````{python, echo = TRUE}
PCBS = dict()
PCBS["Name"] = "PCBS"
PCBS["Teacher"] = "Christophe Pallier"
PCBS["Teacher assistant1"] = "Cedric"
PCBS["Teacher assistant2"] = "Henri"
PCBS["Day"]= "Tuesday"
PCBS["Duration"] = 3
PCBS["Mandatory"] = False 
print(PCBS)
`````  
  


Dictionaries 3/3 Use common operation
========================================================

  - Access to a a key-value pair
  
  - Add a key-value pair
  
  - Delete a key-value pair
  
  - Check for specific key existence

`````{python, echo = TRUE}
PCBS = {  "Name" : "PCBS", "Teacher" : "Christophe Pallier",
"Teacher assistant1" : "Cedric", "Teacher assistant2" : "Henri", 
"Day": "Tuesday", "Duration" : 3, "Mandatory" : False}
PCBS['Day']
PCBS["starting time"] = "13h30"
PCBS.pop("Teacher assistant2")
print(PCBS)
`````    
  


Summary on Python collections (~ Arrays)
========================================================

Python module - example of **Random** 1/4
========================================================

  - Python incorporates in its standard library a multitude of modules for a variety of subjects and problem (network, text processing, mathematics, file and directory access, cryptography...)
  
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html

  - The standard library include in particular a specific module for random (pseudo-random) number generation
  
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
  

Python module - example of **Random** 2/4
========================================================
- Several ways to import a python module
  
``````{python, echo = TRUE}
import random # import random
int_list =[1,2,3]
random.shuffle(int_list)# from that object you have to access all the functions
print(int_list)

import random as rand # import random using a custom local name 
rand.shuffle(int_list) # from that object you have to access all the functions
print(int_list)

from random import shuffle,randint,choice # import only needed function
shuffle(int_list) # use the function directly without object before
print(int_list)

from random import * # import all the functions bundled inside Random at once
shuffle(int_list)
print(int_list)
``````


Python module - example of **Random** 3/4
========================================================

``````{python, echo = TRUE}
from random import *

print(randint(1, 100))    # Pick a random integer between 1 and 100.
print(uniform(1, 100))    # Pick a random float between 1 and 100.

# prints a random value from the list
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(choice(list1))

items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
y = sample(items, 4)    # Pick 4 random items from the list
print(y)
``````

Python module - example of **Random** 4/4
========================================================

``````{python, echo = TRUE}
# using randrange() to generate in range from 20
# to 50. The last parameter 3 is step size to skip
# three numbers when selecting.
print("A random number from range is : ", end="")
print(randrange(20, 50, 3))
``````

Excercices 1/2
========================================================

- Exercice 1: Lists: - Given a list of numbers, print their sum - Given a list of numbers, print their product - Given a list of numbers, print the sum of their squares - Given a list of numbers, print the largest one. - Given a list of numbers, print the second largest

- Exercice 2: Given a list of words, count the number of times each word appears in the list (using dictionary)

- Exercice 3: Lottery pick. Generate 100 random lottery tickets (one ticket is a sequence of 5 digits) and pick one winner out of it. 

- Exercice 4: write a program that generates a random 10 character long password including 6 letters with 2 of them uppercase, 1 digit and 1 special symbol.

- Exercice 5: Monte Carlo estimation of Pi: one way to estimate the value of the pi is to generate a large number of random points in the unit square and see how many fall within the unit circle; their proportion is an estimate of the area of the circle. See https://academo.org/demos/estimating-pi-monte-carlo. Implement the proposed algorithm to estimate the value of pi.

- Exercice 6: Write a program that prints the first N rows of Pascal’s triangle (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMriWTvPXHI).

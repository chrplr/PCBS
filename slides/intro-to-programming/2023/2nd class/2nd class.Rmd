Terminal cheat sheet reminder
========================================================

- Bash commands to navigate directories

  + Print Working Directory. Print the path of the current directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  pwd
  ```

  + List all files of the current directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  ls folder
  ```

  + Moving into folder1 and subfolder2 at once. 
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd folder1/subfolder2
  ```

  + Moving out of a directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ..
  ```
  
  + Going back to the root directory
  ```{bash, echo = TRUE, eval= FALSE}
  cd ~
  ```
  
- "**Tab**" to use the auto-completion

- "**Upper arrow**" to see last commands

- **Ctrl + C** to stop a program execution
    
- Many more bash commands to use...

So far
========================================================

  - Python

  - Variables

  - Data types:
    + integer
    + float
    + string
    + boolean
  
  - If and For loops:
    + syntax use the right keywords **if**, **elif**, **else**, **for**, **in** 
    + don't forget the **:**
    + and the indentation

Constant vs Variable
========================================================

> - So far we have seen how to declare, instantiate and modify variables

> - However, there are "variables" that you don't want to modify, and traditionally in programming, these variables are called constants.

> - Unfortunately, there is no native way of declaring a constant in Python. However, there is an unwritten convention that you should use only uppercase letters.
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     CONST_PI = 3.1415
>     ```

> - Python includes some constants in its core library.
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     import math
>
>     math.pi
>     ```

While loop 1/3
========================================================

> - **While** loops will keep looping until an ending condition is met

> - Unlike the **for** loop, which incorporates a specified number of executions, the **while** loop is best suited for situations with an unknown or very large number of loop iterations.

> - Similar to **if** and **for**, the **while** loop has a syntax with ':' and requires indentation for the following lines to be included in the process.

> - The two key features of a **while** loop are:
>     + the output condition 
>     + the increment statement



While loop 2/3
========================================================

> - Example :

>   ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>   i = 1
>   while i < 4: #  output condition
>     print(i)
>     i += 1     # increment statement
>   ```

> - Which is technically the same as
>   ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>   for i in range(1,4):
>     print(i)
>   ```


While loop 3/3
========================================================

> - The **While** loop will test if the output condition is True, and if not, it will execute the code and then execute the increment statement.
  
> - If either of these two conditions is not correctly specified, you may encounter an error or an infinite loop....
> - Example 1
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}  
>     i = 1
>     while i < 6: #  output condition
>       print(i)
>     ```  

> - Example 2
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
>     i = 1
>     while i != 6:
>       print(i)
>       i += 2
>     ```

Warning on while loop
========================================================

  - A **While** loop cannot directly iterate over the elements of a sequence like the **for** loop
  ```{python, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
  list1 = [1,2,3,0]
  while x in list1:
    print(x)
  ```
  NameError: name 'x' is not defined 
  
  
  Breaking a loop 1/2
========================================================

- You can break out of a loop using the **break** statement. This is useful, for example, when the remaining iterations of the loop are unnecessary.
```{python break, echo =TRUE}
# Checking if a number is primitive
N = 72239
for i in range(2, 300):
  if N % i == 0:
    print(i)
    break 
```

- Other example
```{python break2, echo =TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Checking a password
passwd = 'sesame'

while True:
  code = input('Password? ')
  if code == passwd:
    break
  else:
    print('invalid password')

print("You are in!")
```



Breaking a loop 2/2
========================================================

- The keyword **continue** also very useful for skipping the current iteration.is also very useful to pass the current iteration

```{python continue, echo =TRUE}
for i in range(0,5):
  if i == 3:
    continue
  else:
    print(i)
```



Lists 1/3
========================================================

> - A list is a collection of related objects
  
> - It is declared using square brackets [] with commas separating the objects.

> - Example 1
>   ```{python , echo=TRUE}
>   Years_France_won_worldcup = [1998, 2018]
>   print(Years_France_won_worldcup)
>   ```

> - Example 2
>   ```{python , echo=TRUE}
>   dog_breeds = ["golden", "corgi", "Bulldog", "Husky", "Beagle"]
>   dog_breeds2 = ["golden" "corgi" "Bulldog" "Husky" "Beagle"]
>   print(dog_breeds)
>   print(dog_breeds2)
>   ```

> - Example 3
>   ```{python , echo=TRUE}
>   random_data_type_collection = [ 1, True, "Cats", 3.14]
>   print(random_data_type_collection)
>   ```

Lists 2/3
========================================================

  - You can access elements in a list through their index, which is the same as accessing characters in a string.
```{python , echo=TRUE}
prog_language = ["python", "R", "C", "java", "Go", "Rust"]
print(prog_language[0])
print(prog_language[-1])
```  

```{python , echo=TRUE}
programming_language = "python"
print(programming_language[0])

print(type(programming_language))
```  

Lists 3/3
========================================================

> - Lists, like any other variables, can be used with functions.
>   - append()
>   - remove()
>   - pop()
>   - sort()
>   - len()

> - Example
>   ```{python , echo=TRUE}
>   prog_language = ["python", "R", "C", "java", "Go", "Rust"]
>   prog_language.append("html")
>   prog_language.append("PHP")
>   print(prog_language)

>   prog_language.remove("html")

>   len(prog_language)

>   prog_language.sort()
>   print(prog_language)
>   ```

Tuples 1/3
========================================================

> - **Tuples** are very similar to Lists and is used for data collection
  
> - They are declared with parentheses **()** instead of square brackets and with commas **,** to separate the objects.

> - Example
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     date_covid_shots = ("21-04-15", "21-05-18", "21-09-20")

>     print(type(date_covid_shots))

>     print(date_covid_shots[1])  # Accessible as list with index with []
>     print(len(date_covid_shots))
>     ```
  
Tuples 2/3
========================================================

> - In contrast to lists, they are immutable and can't be modified.
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE}    
>     date_covid_shots = ("21-04-15", "21-05-18", "21-09-20")
>     date_covid_shots.append("21-09-27")
>     ```
  
> - You can't change the order of items or modify the value of an item.

> - Tuples are best suited when you need ordered lists that would never change
>     + For example, if you want to represent a calendar, days and years can be coded as tuples since they won't change but are ordered.

Tuples 3/3
========================================================
  
> - Note that you can combine lists and tuples
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE}
>     Cocktails = [("Cosmo","5€"),("Daiquiri","7€"),("B52","6€")]
>     Cocktails.append(("Mojito","7€"))

>     print(Cocktails)
>     ```

> - NB: You can also declare a tuple using the **tuple()** constructor.
>     ```{python, echo = TRUE}
>     date_covid_shots = tuple(["21-04-15", "21-05-18", "21-09-20"])
>     # in this line you transform a list into a tuple
>     print(type(date_covid_shots))
>     ```

Sets 1/2
========================================================

> - **Sets** are very similar to **lists** but differ in that they are unordered, unindexed, and do not allow duplicate values. However, they are mutable.

  
> - Sets are declared using curly braces **{}** and items again are separated with **,**.

> - Example  
>     ```{python, echo = TRUE}
>     fruit_I_like = {"apple", "pineapple", "peach"}
>     print(type(fruit_I_like))
>     print(fruit_I_like)

>     fruit_I_like.add("strawberry")
>     "strawberry" in fruit_I_like # Check if a fruit is in my set
>     fruit_I_like.remove("apple")
>     print(fruit_I_like)
>     ```
  
Sets 2/2
========================================================

> - You cannot add or remove items in a **set**, or access items with an index. Attempting to do so will result in an error.
>     ```{python, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE}  
>     fruit_I_like[0]
>     fruit_I_like.append("banana")
>     ```

> - The **append()** method doesn't work with **sets** because it implies an order to add an item at the end, which sets do not have.
        
> - NB: you can also declare a set using a set() constructor (as for the tuple)
>     ```{python, echo = TRUE}
>     date_covid_shots = set(["21-04-15", "21-05-18", "21-09-20"])
>     # in this line you transform a list into a tuple
>     print(type(date_covid_shots))
>     ```      


Dictionaries 1/5
========================================================

> - **Dictionaries** are data structure that uses data in key-value pairs.
  
> - Each item of a dictionary is a key-value pair.
  
> - Each key in a dictionary must be unique.
  
> - Dictionaries are declared in a very specific way.
>     - my_dictionary = { "key1" : value1, "key2": value2 ...}

Dictionaries 2/5
========================================================

> - Example 
>     ```{python, echo = TRUE}
>     PCBS = {
>     "Name" : "PCBS",
>     "Teacher" : "Christophe Pallier",
>     "Teacher assistant" : "Henri",
>     "Course" : ["1", "2"],
>     "Day": "Tuesday",
>     "Duration" : 3,
>     "Mandatory" : False}
  
>     print(PCBS["Name"])
>     print(PCBS["Teacher"])
>     print(PCBS["Teacher assistant"])
>     print(PCBS["Course"])
>     print(PCBS["Day"])
>     print(PCBS["Duration"])
>     print(PCBS["Mandatory"])
>     ```
  
  
Dictionaries 3/5 Create a Dictionary  
========================================================

>  - But you have several methods to create a dictionary:
    
    
> - Example1
>     ```{python, echo = TRUE}
>     PCBS = {}
>     PCBS["Name"] = "PCBS"
>     PCBS["Teacher"] = "Christophe Pallier"
>     PCBS["Teacher assistant"] = "Henri"
>     PCBS["Course"] = ["1", "2"]
>     PCBS["Day"] = "Tuesday"
>     PCBS["Duration"] = 3
>     PCBS["Mandatory"] = False 

>     print(PCBS)

>     print(type(PCBS))
>     ```  


Dictionaries 4/5 Create a Dictionary  
========================================================

> - Which is exactly the same as
>     ```{python, echo = TRUE}
>     PCBS = dict()
>     PCBS["Name"] = "PCBS"
>     PCBS["Teacher"] = "Christophe Pallier"
>     PCBS["Teacher assistant"] = "Henri"
>     PCBS["Course"] = ["1", "2"]
>     PCBS["Day"]= "Tuesday"
>     PCBS["Duration"] = 3
>     PCBS["Mandatory"] = False 
>     print(PCBS)
>     ```  
>     - But with a constructor dict()


Dictionaries 5/5 Common operation
========================================================

> - Access to a a key-value pair
  
> - Add a key-value pair
  
> - Delete a key-value pair
  
> - Check for specific key existence

> - Example
>     ```{python, echo = TRUE,options(width = 11)}
>     PCBS = {  "Name" : "PCBS", "Teacher" : "Christophe Pallier",
>     "Teacher assistant" : "Henri", 
>     "Day": "Tuesday", "Duration" : 3, "Mandatory" : False}
>     PCBS["Course"] = ["1", "2"]
>     PCBS['Course'].append("3")
>     PCBS['Day']
>     PCBS["starting time"] = "14h00"
>     PCBS.pop("Teacher assistant")
>     print(PCBS)
>     ```

So far
========================================================

  - Python, its life, its choice

  - Data types: (integer / float / string / boolean)
  
  - **If**, **For** and **While** loops: 

  - Data collections: (list, tuple, set, dictionary)
    
  - Functions

Today
========================================================


### - Back on functions

### - Building abstraction with :

#####    + Recursive functions

#####    + High order functions (part 1)


Building abstraction
========================================================

- In programming, we control the intellectual complexity of our programs by building abstractions that hide details when appropriate

+ That is exactly what you do when you use function like **len()**

+ That is exactly what you do when you build your own functions/modules

- This allows you to chunk compound operations as conceptual units, give them a name and manipulate them

- In this module, you will explore two other means to build abstractions with functions: recursive functions and higher-order functions.

Back on function
========================================================

  - A function is a block of instructions that is given a name
  
  - Functions must be defined before they are called

  - Using functions avoids to duplicate code (i.e. by cutting and pasting)

  - Using functions typically serves to make the code more readable (and maybe shorter)

  - If you do not call the function, it will never be executed
  
  - A function can:
    + have an input (one or several arguments of any kind of data types) 
    + have an output (return one or several data)
    + but not necessarily
    
  - Variables defined in a function stay in the function
  
  - One good practice is to place functions in an external modules such as in the standard library 
  
  - Functions can call functions
  
  - Functions can call themselves...
  
  
  
Recursive function
========================================================


  - Remember what I said about recursive functions last time ?


Recursive function
========================================================


  - Remember what I said about recursive functions last time ?

  - Recursion is a function calling itself
  
  - That has a termination condition
  
  - And an increment statement



Recursive function example 1
========================================================

  - OK boomer

![](/home/henri/Documents/Cours/PCBS/slides/2021-intro-to-programming/fourth class/recursivity.png)

Recursive function example 2
========================================================

  - Recursion and lists: add every number in list with for loops
  
```{python, echo =TRUE}
## With a loop for

def sum(list):
  sum = 0
  
  # Add every number in the list.
  for i in range(0, len(list)):
    sum = sum + list[i]
        
  # Return the sum.
  return sum

print(sum([5,7,3,8,10]))
```
Recursive function example 2
========================================================

  - Recursion and lists: with recursion
  
```{python, echo =TRUE}
def sum(list):
  if len(list)==1:
    return list[0]
  else:
    return list[0] + sum(list[1:])

print(sum([5,7,3,8,10]))
```
  

Recursive function example 3
========================================================

  - Factorial with for loops

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def calcFactorial(number):
    factorial = 1
    
    for count in range (1, number):
        factorial = factorial*count
            
    factorial = factorial*number
    return factorial
  
print(calcFactorial(5))
```

Recursive function example 3
========================================================

  - Factorial with for recursion
  
```{python, echo =TRUE}
def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else :
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  
print(factorial(5))
```

- But it has limitations. Everytime a function calls itself it allocates memory for that new call of the function. So you might easily run into an error. Python stops the function calls after a depth of 1000 calls. 
      RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

- You don't have that problem with the for loop


Recursive function example 3
========================================================

```{python, eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE}

def calcFactorial(number):
    factorial = 1
    
    for count in range (1, number):
        factorial = factorial*count
            
    factorial = factorial*number
    return factorial
  
print(calcFactorial(3000))


def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else :
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  
print(factorial(1000))
```



Recursive function example 3
========================================================

```{python,eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)

def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else :
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  
print(factorial(1000))
```
- But keep in mind that it has limitations and recursion is very suited for certain problems but not for all

Exercices on recursion
========================================================

1 - Write a recursive function to reverse a list

2 - Write a script that displays the Koch snowflake (see on wikipedia) using a recursive function. You can use the turtle graphics module to draw on screen (as shown in section 16.5 of thinkcspy).

3 - Write a recursive function to generate all permutations of a list of values

4 - Write a script that returns the pathnames of all the files contained inside a directory (at any depth of the hierarchy). You will need to use os.listdir() and os.path.isdir().

Exercice 1
========================================================

1 - Write a recursive function to reverse a list

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def rev(l):
  if len(l) == 0: 
    return []
  return [l[-1]] + rev(l[:-1])
  
print(rev(["a", "b", "c", "d"]))
```

Exercice 2
========================================================

2 - Write a script that displays the Koch snowflake (see on wikipedia) using a recursive function. You can use the turtle graphics (https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/turtle.html) module to draw on screen (as shown in section 16.5 of thinkcspy).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake


```{python,eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
import turtle

def Koch(n, l):
    if n == 0:
        turtle.forward(l)
    else:
        Koch(n - 1, l / 3)
        turtle.left(60)
        Koch(n - 1, l / 3)
        turtle.right(120)
        Koch(n - 1, l / 3)
        turtle.left(60)
        Koch(n - 1, l / 3)

turtle.penup()
turtle.backward(600)
turtle.pendown()

Koch(1, 400)
Koch(2, 400)
Koch(3, 400)

turtle.exitonclick()
```


Exercice 3
========================================================

3 - Write a recursive function to generate all permutations of a string of character

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def perms(s):        
    if(len(s)==1): 
      return [s]
    result=[]
    for i,v in enumerate(s):
        result += [v+p for p in perms(s[:i]+s[i+1:])]
    return result


perms('abc')
```

Exercice 4
========================================================

4 - Write a script that returns the pathnames of all the files contained inside a directory (at any depth of the hierarchy). You will need to use os.listdir() and os.path.isdir().


```{python, echo=TRUE}
import os
 
def listdirs(rootdir):
  for file in os.listdir(rootdir):
    print(file)
    d = os.path.join(rootdir, file)
    if os.path.isdir(d):
      print(d)
      listdirs(d)
 
rootdir = '/home/henri/Documents/Cours/PCBS/slides/2021-intro-to-programming/'
listdirs(rootdir)
```


Higher-order functions : Intro
========================================================

  - A higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:

    + takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. functions are assigned as variable)
  
    + returns a function as its result
  
  - High order function had a new layer of complexity in term of abstraction

Application of high order function 1
========================================================

  - Example of Function as an arguments
  
```{python, echo = TRUE} 
# Python program to illustrate functions 
# can be passed as arguments to other functions 
def shout(text): 
    return text.upper() 
    
def whisper(text): 
    return text.lower() 
    
def greet(function): 
    # storing the function in a variable 
    greeting = function("Hi, I am created by a function \
    passed as an argument.") 
    print(greeting)  
 
  
greet(shout) 
greet(whisper)
```


Application of high order function 2  1/4
========================================================

  - Consider these examples:
```{python, echo=TRUE}
def sum_naturals(n):
  total, k = 0, 1
  while k <= n:
    total, k = total + k, k + 1
  return total
sum_naturals(4)
```  

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def sum_cubes(n):
  total, k = 0, 1
  while k <= n:
    total, k = total + pow(k, 3), k + 1
  return total
sum_cubes(4)
```

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def pi_sum(n):
  total, k = 0, 1
  while k <= n:
    total, k = total + 8 / (k * (k + 2)), k + 4
  return total
pi_sum(100)
```
  
  - These functions have lots of things in common except for the names and the calculation of k
  
  
Application of high order function 2  2/4
======================================================== 

  - The pattern is 
  
```{python, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}  
def <name>(n):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + <term>(k), <next>(k)
    return total
```

  - The presence of this kind of pattern is an evidence for a new level or abstraction that can be brought
  
  - for example in putting <term> and <next> as arguments

Application of high order function 2  2/4
======================================================== 

  - The pattern is the following
  
```{python, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}  
def <name>(n):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + <term>(k), <next>(k)
    return total
```

  - The presence of this kind of pattern is an evidence for a new level or abstraction that can be brought
  
  - In that case in putting <term> and <next> as arguments
```{python, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}  
#changing the name
def summation(n, term, next):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + term(k), next(k)
        return total
```


Application of high order function 2  3/4
========================================================

```{python, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}  
def summation(n, term, next):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + term(k), next(k)
        return total

def cube(k):
  return pow(k,3)

def successor(k):
  return k + 1

def sum_cubes(n):
  return summation(n,cube,successor)

sum_cubes(3)

```


Application of high order function 2  4/4
========================================================

```{python, echo = TRUE}  
def summation(n, term, next):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + term(k), next(k)
        return total

def identity(k):
  return k

def successor(k):
  return k + 1

def sum_naturals(n):
  return summation(n, identity, successor)

sum_naturals(3)
```

Reminder
========================================================

 
  - Bash commands to navigate directories
   
  - Useful commands:

    + **pwd**     Print Working Directory. Print the path of of the current directory
    
    + **ls /folder**        list all files of the current directory
    
    + **cd /folder1/folder2**     moving into folder1 and folder2 at once. 
    
    + **cd ..**        moving out of a directory 
  
  - "Tab" to use the auto-completion
    
  - Many more bash commands to use...


So far
========================================================

  - Python

  - Data types:
    + integer
    + float
    + string
    + boolean
  
  - **If**, **For** and **While** loops: 

  - Data collections:
    + list
    + tuple
    + set
    + dictionary
    
  - Functions

Today
========================================================


### - Back on functions

### - Building abstraction with :

####    + Recursive functions

####    + High order functions


Building abstraction
========================================================

- In programming, we control the intellectual complexity of our programs by building abstractions that hide details when appropriate

+ That is exactly what you do when you use function like **len()**

+ That is exactly what you do when you build your own functions/modules

- This allows you to chunk compound operations as conceptual units, give them a name and manipulate them

- In this module, you will explore two other means to build abstractions with functions: recursive functions and higher-order functions.

Back on function
========================================================

  - A function is a block of instructions that is given a name
  
  - Functions must be defined before they are called

  - Using functions avoids to duplicate code (i.e. by cutting and pasting)

  - Using functions typically serves to make the code more readable (and maybe shorter)

  - If you do not call the function, it will never be executed
  
  - A function can:
    + have an input (one or several arguments of any kind of data types) 
    + have an output (return one or several data)
    + but not necessarily
  
  - One good practice is to place functions in an external modules such as in the standard library 
  
  - Functions can call functions
  
  - Functions can call themselves...
  
  
  
Recursive function
========================================================


  - Remember what I said about recursive functions last time ?


Recursive function
========================================================


  - Remember what I said about recursive functions last time ?

  - Recursion is a function calling itself
  
  - That has a termination condition
  
  - And an increment statement



Recursive function example 1
========================================================

  - OK boomer

![](/home/henri/Documents/Cours/PCBS/slides/2021-intro-to-programming/fourth class/recursivity.png)

Recursive function example 2
========================================================

  - Recursion and lists: add every number in list with for loops
  
```{python, echo =TRUE}
## With a loop for

def sum(list):
  sum = 0
  
  # Add every number in the list.
  for i in range(0, len(list)):
    sum = sum + list[i]
        
  # Return the sum.
  return sum

print(sum([5,7,3,8,10]))
```
Recursive function example 2
========================================================

  - Recursion and lists: with recursion
  
```{python, echo =TRUE}
def sum(list):
  if len(list)==1:
    return list[0]
  else:
    return list[0] + sum(list[1:])

print(sum([5,7,3,8,10]))
```
  

Recursive function example 3
========================================================

  - Factorial with for loops

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def calcFactorial(number):
    factorial = 1
    
    for count in range (1, number):
        factorial = factorial*count
            
    factorial = factorial*number
    return factorial
  
print(calcFactorial(5))
```

Recursive function example 3
========================================================

  - Factorial with for recursion
  
```{python, echo =TRUE}
def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else :
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  
print(factorial(5))
```

- But it has limitations. Everytime a function calls itself it allocates memory for that new call of the function. So you might easily run into an error. Python stops the function calls after a depth of 1000 calls. 
      RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison

- You don't have that problem with the for loop


Recursive function example 3
========================================================

```{python, eval = FALSE, echo =TRUE}

def calcFactorial(number):
    factorial = 1
    
    for count in range (1, number):
        factorial = factorial*count
            
    factorial = factorial*number
    return factorial
  
print(calcFactorial(3000))


def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else :
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  
print(factorial(1000))
```



Recursive function example 3
========================================================

```{python,eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)

def factorial(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else :
    return n * factorial(n-1)
  
print(factorial(1000))
```
- But keep in mind that it has limitations and recursion is very suited for certain problems but not for all

Exercices on recursion
========================================================

1 - Write a recursive function to reverse a list

2 - Write a script that displays the Koch snowflake (see on wikipedia) using a recursive function. You can use the turtle graphics module to draw on screen (as shown in section 16.5 of thinkcspy).

3 - Write a recursive function to generate all permutations of a list of values

4 - Write a script that returns the pathnames of all the files ending in .txt contained inside a directory (at any depth of the hierarchy). You will need to use os.listdir() and os.path.isdir().

Exercice 1
========================================================

1 - Write a recursive function to reverse a list

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def rev(l):
  if len(l) == 0: 
    return []
  return [l[-1]] + rev(l[:-1])
  
print(rev(["a", "b", "c", "d"]))
```

Exercice 2
========================================================

2 - Write a script that displays the Koch snowflake (see on wikipedia) using a recursive function. You can use the turtle graphics module to draw on screen (as shown in section 16.5 of thinkcspy).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake


```{python,eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
import turtle

def Koch(n, l):
    if n == 0:
        turtle.forward(l)
    else:
        Koch(n - 1, l / 3)

        turtle.left(60)
        Koch(n - 1, l / 3)

        turtle.right(120)
        Koch(n - 1, l / 3)

        turtle.left(60)
        Koch(n - 1, l / 3)

turtle.penup()
turtle.backward(600)
turtle.pendown()

Koch(1, 400)
Koch(2, 400)
Koch(3, 400)

turtle.exitonclick()
```


Exercice 3
========================================================

3 - Write a recursive function to generate all permutations of a list of values

```{python, echo=TRUE}
def perms(s):        
    if(len(s)==1): return [s]
    result=[]
    for i,v in enumerate(s):
        result += [v+p for p in perms(s[:i]+s[i+1:])]
    return result


perms('abc')
```

Exercice 4
========================================================

4 - Write a script that returns the pathnames of all the files ending in .txt contained inside a directory (at any depth of the hierarchy). You will need to use os.listdir() and os.path.isdir().


```{python, echo=TRUE}

  
  

```


Higher-order functions
========================================================

- higher-order function is a function that does at least one of the following:

  + takes one or more functions as arguments (i.e. procedural parameters),
  + returns a function as its result.

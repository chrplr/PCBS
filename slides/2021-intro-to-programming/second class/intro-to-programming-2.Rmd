So far
========================================================


- Variables

- Data types:
  + integer
  + float
  + string
  + boolean

- If and For loops:
  + syntax " : "
  + indentation 
  

Today
========================================================


- While loop

- Other python data types:
  + list
  + set
  + tuple
  + dictionnarie
  
- Excercies


While loop 1/2
========================================================

- The **for** loop incorporate a specified number of execution of a task, the while loop is best suited for unknown or very large number of loop.

- While loop will do a task all over again a set of tasks until an ending instruction.

- As for **if** and **for**, **while** has a syntax and need indentation for the following lines to be included in the process

- The two key features of a while loop are:
  + the output condition 
  + the increment statement
  

```{python, echo=TRUE}
i = 1
while i < 6: #  output condition
  print(i)
  i += 1     # increment statement
  
## Which is technically the same as

for i in range(1,6):
  print(i)

```
While loop 2/2
========================================================
  
  - **While** loop will test if the output condition is True and if not it will execute the code and execute the increment statement
  
  - If one of those two condition are not correctly specified you'll encounter an error or an infinite loop...
        
        i = 1
        while i < 6: #  output condition
          print(i)
          
        while i != 6:
          print(i)
          x += 2



List
========================================================

  - A list is a collection of related objects
  
  - It's declared with brackets [] with a comma between two objects
  
```{python , echo=TRUE}
France_world_cup_winner1 = [1998 2018]
France_world_cup_winner2 = [1998, 2018]

print(France_world_cup_winner1, France_world_cup_winner2)

dog_breeds = ["golden", "corgi", "Bulldog", "Husky", "Beagle"]
dog_breeds2 = ["golden" "corgi" "Bulldog" "Husky" "Beagle"]

print(dog_breeds, dog_breeds2)
```

Excercices
========================================================

- Exercice 1: Lists: - Given a list of numbers, print their sum - Given a list of numbers, print their product - Given a list of numbers, print the sum of their squares - Given a list of numbers, print the largest one. - Given a list of numbers, print the second largest

- Exercice 2: Given a list of words, count the number of times each word appears in the list (using dictionary)

- Exercice 3: Lottery pick. Generate 100 random lottery tickets (one ticket is a sequence of 5 digits) and pick one winner out of it. 

- Exercice 4: write a program that generates a random 10 character long password including 6 letters with 2 of them uppercase, 1 digit and 1 special symbol.

- Exercice 5: Monte Carlo estimation of Pi: one way to estimate the value of the π is to generate a large number of random points in the unit square and see how many fall within the unit circle; their proportion is an estimate of the area of the circle. See https://academo.org/demos/estimating-pi-monte-carlo. Implement the proposed algorithm to estimate the value of π.

- Exercice 6: Write a program that prints the first N rows of Pascal’s triangle (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMriWTvPXHI).

Context
========================================================


- Why programming ?


- Why python ?


- Why programming in python for cognitive sciences ?


Survival rules for programming
========================================================



1- Try by yourself before looking for solutions

2- Internet is your best friend

3- Read the manual

4- There is always a manual

5- Have you read the fucking manual ?

6- Not yet ? Then read it

7- Always read the error message

Writing and running a program with python
========================================================

- Open sublime

- Write: <br><span style="color: grey;">`$ print("Hello !")`</span>

- Save the file as *hello.py*

- Open a terminal and navigate to your program and run the command: <br><span style="color: grey;">`$ python hello.py`</span>


Variables and data in python
========================================================


- Manipulating and storing data

- Declaring variables

- Modifiying variables

- Naming variables:
      - Use alphanumeric characters and underscores (but no number nor underscore as first character)
      - Use a descriptive name
      - Avoid short versions
      - Variable are case-sensitive: upper-case and lower-case make a difference 

- Different types of variables: Primitive types
  + intergers
  + float
  + string 
  + boolean



Numeric data et operations 1/2
========================================================


- Differences between integers and floats

- Arithmetic operators + - * / %


- Exercice : calculate and print the result of this operation


$$\frac{15}{3+2}-(\frac{\frac{100}{4}}{5})*2$$

Numeric data et operations 2/2
========================================================


- Differences between integers and floats

- Arithmetic operators + - * / %


- Exercice : calculate and print the result of this operation


$$\frac{15}{3+2}-(\frac{\frac{100}{4}}{5})*2$$

```{python echo=TRUE}
x = 15/(3+2) - (100/4/5)*2
print(x)
```


Strings 1/3
========================================================


- Used to store text (most of the time)

- Strings are declared with " " or ' '. Examples:
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$ animal = "Dog"`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$ class = "Intro to programming in python"`</span>

- String can easily be concatenated the operator +


```{python echo=TRUE}
greetings = "Hello"
presentation = "My name is"
name = "Henri"
print( greetings + presentation + name)
```


Strings 2/3
========================================================


- Used to store text (most of the time)

- Strings are declared with " " or ' '. Examples:
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$ animal = "Dog"`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$ class = "Intro to programming in python"`</span>

- String can easily be concatenated the operator +


```{python echo=TRUE}
greetings = "Hello"
presentation = "My name is"
name = "Henri"
print( greetings + presentation + name)
```

- Exercice: insert whitespace between the words.

print( greetings + presentation + name)
```

```{python echo=TRUE}
greetings = "Hello"
presentation = "My name is"
name = "Henri"
print( greetings + ' ' + presentation + ' ' + name)

space = ' '
print(greetings + space + presentation + space + name)
```

Strings 3/3
========================================================

- Functions working with strings:

  - **len()** calculate the length of a function
    Example
```{python echo=TRUE}
greetings = "Hello"
print(len(greetings))
```    
    
  - **replace()** can replace a pattern in a string
  Example
```{python echo=TRUE}
greetings = "Hello"
print(greetings)
print(greetings.replace('e','a'))
```  
    
    - ...
    
Booleans
========================================================    
    
  - A boolean is a pretty simple variable but sometimes complex to deal with
  
  - It can have only two values **True** or **False**
  
  - It is used usually to store the truth value of logic
  
  Example:
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$   Is_it_Weekend = False`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$   print(Is_it_Weekend)`</span>

```{python echo=FALSE}
Is_it_Weekend = False
print(Is_it_Weekend)

```


Program flow 1/4
========================================================

- A program normally executes sequentially from top to bottom

- But some instructions can change the flow. For examples *if* and *for* loops 

- **if** will test for a conditional comparison. If a condition is true then we can execute some lines of codes if it's false we will not execute those lines of codes (but why not others).

Example 1:

<br><span style="color: grey;">`$   Weekend = "False"`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$   if Weekend :`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$       print("Time to go to work")`</span>

<br><span style="color: grey;">`$       print("Time to go to work")print("Let's do nothing and chill"`</span>

<br><span style="color: grey;">`$       print("Let's do nothing and chill"`</span>


Example2 :

<br><span style="color: grey;">`$   string = "This string is long but not that long. How long is it ?"`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$   if len(string) < 10:`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$       print("This string has less than 10 character")`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$   elif len(string) < 20:`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$       print("This string has less than 20 character")`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$   else len(string) >30:`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$       print("That string is way too long for me...")`</span>

elif len(string) >30:
  print("That string is too long for me...")
```

Program flow 2/4
========================================================

- You can also define other alternatives with **elif**

- you can make use different ways to make your comparison:
      - **and** 
      - **or**
      - **not**
  
- You can as well use comparative expressions:
      - **<** 
      - **>**
      - **<=**
      - **==** tests for equality
      - **!=** tests for inequality

Be careful **=** is not the same as **==**
```{python echo=TRUE}
age = 30

age == 30

```      

Program flow 3/4
========================================================

- **for** loops iterate one or a set of operations several times.

Example 1:

<br><span style="color: grey;">`$  for x in range(10):`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$     print(x)`</span>
```{python echo=TRUE}
for x in range(10):
  print(x)
```

  print(x)
```

Example 2:
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$  for i in range(5,10):`</span>
<br><span style="color: grey;">`$     print(i)`</span>
```{python echo=TRUE}
for i in range(5,10):
  print(i)
```    

Program flow 4/4
========================================================

- With **for** loops you see that your program flow is not always unilateral from the top to the bottom of your script

- Then go on http://pythontutor.com/ and paste the code of the game.

- Look at the program flow to see how it jumps from one code section to another

Excercices
========================================================

- Exercice 1: Write code that prints the string "All work no play makes Jack a dull boy" 50 times

- Exercice 2: Write code that prints the squares of all integers between 1 and 100 using range

- Exercice 3: Write code that browses the integer from 0 to 100 but only prints the number 1, 50 and 100

- Exercice 4: Write code that prints only odd numbers between 0 and 100

- Exercice 5: Write code that computes the factorial of an integer (no function, no recursion, just a loop)

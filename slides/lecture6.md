# Programming Experiments

Psychology experiments typically involve:

- presenting (auditory, visual, tactile, ...) stimuli with a precise schedule
- recording behavioral and/or physiological responses
- giving feedback to the S / adapting to his/her performance
- analyzing responses (on-line or off-line)

# Python's offer



- Modules to create and run experiments
     * expyriment 
     * psychopy

- Modules to explore, visualize and analyze data:
     * pandas
     * matplotlib
     * seaborn
     * statsmodels

(Note: In real life, R and Matlab can be relevant too)

# Project Mode

1. Take an experimental paradigm (classic or not), program it (variations welcome!). 

2. Write good documentation (website in form of github pages) so that other people can use your code.

3. (optional) If possible:
    - run it on a few pilot subjects, 
    - perform  succinct data exploration (descriptive stats and graphics)
    - include a short report on the webpage of the project.

# Stroop effect

Naming the color of the ink is difficult when there is a confict with the word itself.
This is supposed to show that reading is automatic.

Question: what happens if you need to read the wor and ignore the colour of the ink?

# Distance effect


Numbers between 1 and 99 are presented sequentially. The S must compare each of them to 55 (is is smaller or larger?)

# Frequency and Length effects

In the Lexical Decision Task, S have to decide if a string of letters is a real word or not. 
RT are influenced by word frequency and length in letters.

# Next week

* You will have to have either selected one of the proposed topics (list to be announced), or come up with a proposal.

* I will show how to setup a github repository for your project and the basic usage of git.

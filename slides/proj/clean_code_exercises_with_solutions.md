# Clean Code Principles

The goal is to make code **easy to understand** and **easy to change**.

* **CC1 Use meaningful names**.

    Reveal purpose. Replace magic numbers.
    Say what functions do. Reveal/Avoid side-effects. Remove ambiguity.
    Use different words for different concepts.
    Use the appropriate level of description.

* **CC2 Create functions that do one thing**.

* **CC3 DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself**.

* **CC4 Explain yourself in code, not comments**.

# Instructions for exercises: Review

1) In each exercise, you will **review** a piece of code and identify issues in the code
using the clean code principles.

2) During your review, you will write each issue you find as a comment on commie.io.

3) After some time, we will gather to share and discuss the issues we have found.

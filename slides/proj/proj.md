PROJect
=======

Choose a programming project with a topic related to cognitive science, e.g data analysis, simulations or creating an experiments. A list of papers are available at <https://github.com/chrplr/PCBS/tree/master/pdfs/papers-for-projects>, but you can select your own topic. 
 
Rules of the game:

* your code should work and be **portable**, i.e., use relatives paths, so that anyone can run it **
* your code should be **readable**, following, as much a possible, [Clean Code](https://pcbs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tips-to-write-clean-code.html). 
* do not be overambitious, the smaller the code the better (~30~100 lines of code (not comments) is fine)

* your project must contain a readable documentation written in  [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
      
* You project must be publicly available on http://github.com   
* You must use the **Git** version system.

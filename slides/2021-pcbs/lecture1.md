# Why this course?

Typical tasks for Cognitive Scientists:

- generate (visual, auditory, tactile, ...) stimuli and run experiments
- analyze experimental data (and do reproducible science)
- analyze linguistic corpora
- simulate cognitive or processes (e.g. with neural networks)

And also:

 - need to automate boring tasks ("either you are the slave of your computer or the computer is your slave")

A highly recommended book (as well as all books by Al Stweigart):

**Aim: to teach useful tools for cognitive science, and to help you improve your programming skills, by implementing typical activities**

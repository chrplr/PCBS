# Clean Code Principles

The goal is to make code **easy to understand** and **easy to change**.

**CC1 Use meaningful names**.
Reveal purpose. Replace magic numbers.
Say what functions do. Describe side-effects. Remove ambiguity.
Use different words for different concepts.
Use the appropriate level of abstraction

**CC2 Create functions that do one thing**. Build abstractions.

**CC3 DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself**. Avoid code duplication.

**CC4 Explain yourself in code, not comments**. Comments do not make up for bad code.

# Exercises

We will **review** pieces of code from past student projects,
using the clean code principles to identify issues.

For some of these pieces we will then try to **rewrite** the code
to resolve the identified issues.

---

# Exercises

[Review] For each piece of code, you will:

1. Open the commie.io link and **click the "Save new Paste" button**
to work on your own copy.

2. Read the code, try to understand it, find clean code issues,
and write them down as comments on commie.io.

    If possible, assign each issue to one of the clean code principles and
    use the following template for your comment:
    "[CC# Name_of_clean_code_principle] Some specific details about the issue."

3. When time is up, gather with the rest of the class to discuss the issues
we've found. You may be asked to share your commented code copy.

# Exercises

[Rewrite] For some pieces of code, you will then:

4. Rewrite the code to resolve the issues using any text editor.

5. When time is up, gather with the rest of the class to discuss possible solutions.
You may be asked to share your code rewrite.

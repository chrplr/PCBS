=======================================
Using the terminal and the command line
=======================================
 
Inside a Terminal, you interact with a program that is waiting for you to type in
commands and execute them.

This program is called a *shell* (see
http://linuxcommand.sourceforge.net/lc3_learning_the_shell.php ).




In this lecture, you only essentially only need to know three commands in order to navigate in the filesystem:

-  *ls*: list the content of the current working directory
-  *pwd*: path of current working directory
-  *cd*: change directory

Read http://linuxcommand.sourceforge.net/lc3_lts0020.php to learn about them.

Watch the video at   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yhcWvBt7ZE&t and try to perform the activities in it (the insturctions walso work for Mac or Linux: you just need to open a standard Terminal when in Windows you need to start 'Gih Bash').

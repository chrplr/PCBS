Fun programming language
************************


If you liked Scratch, but found it too much child-oriented, you may enjoy:

- `Processing <www.processing.org>`__  a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.
- `Sonic Pi <https://sonic-pi.net>`__  a code-based music creation and performance tool.

Give them a look: these are two great programming tools to create visual and audio effects and, being designed for non programmers, they are very good to learn the bases of programming without pain.

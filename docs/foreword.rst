Foreword
========

Students in cognitive/neuro science need to learn programming in order to:

* have a basic understanding of how computers work because of the importance of the Computational Theory of Mind in Cognitive Science (whether one like sit or not).
* Prepare and run experiments on humans or animals, analyze data, run computational simulations, ...
* Automate the boring stuff such as, repetitive work on files, web scraping, ...

This book was born out of lectures given at the “`Cogmaster <https://cogmaster.ens.psl.eu/en>`_” from its inception in 2005. The lectures comes from various courses (*Atelier d'experimentation humaine*,  *Atelier d'Analyse de données expérimentales*, *Introduction to R*, *Introduction to Programming with Python*, ...) taught by me and my colleages and friends `Mark Wexler <http://wexler.free.fr/>`_, `Sylvain Charron <https://fr.linkedin.com/in/sylvain-charron-410a9810>`_, `Christophe Lalanne <https://aliquote.org>`_,  Ewan Dunbar, Cédric Foucault, Henri van den Driessche.

More information about the current course, *Programming for Cognitive and Brain Sciences*, slides and corrections to exercices, is available at https//github.com/chrplr/PCBS and in the chapter :doc:`cogmaster-lectures` of the present document. 

This book can also be used as a self-teaching tool. Depending on the reader's prior programming experience and interests, different sections will be relevant. We have tried to keep the sections as independent as possible to faciliate the study, but you will find some cross referencing when needed. Although we cover many topics, some are only touched superficially; the reader should definitely check the :doc:`resources` section to go further. 

The latest version of this document is always available at https://pcbs.readthedocs.io and can be downloaded as a `single pdf file <https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/pcbs/latest/pcbs.pdf>`_.

Use of regular expressions to extract and transform information from text.

`Watch on youtube <https://youtu.be/xseViAOrKvM>`_

**2. Read the first two sections in Chapter 7 of Al Sweigart's book "Automate the boring stuff", page 161 to 166.**

This will show you how regular expressions can be used in Python.

The book is `available on Schoology <https://app.schoology.com/course/4637783206/materials/gp/4653909275>`_

**3. Do all the lessons of the interactive tutorial at** `regexone.com <https://regexone.com/>`_

This will teach you, through practice, the syntax of regular expressions.

**4. Continue onto the practice problems at** `regexone.com <https://regexone.com/>`_

To practice putting regular expressions to use in real-world problems.

Example in Cognitive Science research
-------------------------------------

Regular expressions have many applications, especially in cognitive science.

For example, Christophe Pallier (1999) used regular expressions to find syllable boundaries in words from their phonetic representation. To know more, see : `Pallier (1999). Syllabation des représentations phonétiques de brulex et de lexique. <https://www.pallier.org/papers/syllabation.pdf>`_

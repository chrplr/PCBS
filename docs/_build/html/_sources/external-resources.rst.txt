-  I **strongly recommend** the freely available book `Automate the
   boring stuff with Python: Practical programming for total
   beginners. <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>`__ to total novices
   (as well as the other books by the author). For those who dislike
   reading, there are videos on the site.


-  See `Python in a Nutshell <02-Python_in_a_nutshell/Python_in_a_nutshell.md>`__

-  Read the Python scripts in the `games <games/>`__ folder.

Resources to learn the command shell
------------------------------------

Why learn the command shell?

   “What is a command shell? To properly understand the role of a shell,
   it’s necessary to visualize what a computer does for you. Basically,
   a computer is a tool; in order to use that tool, you must tell it
   what to do—or give it “commands.” These commands take many forms,
   such as clicking with a mouse on certain parts of the screen. But
   that is only one form of command input.

..

   By far the most versatile way to express what you want the computer
   to do is by using an abbreviated language called script. In script,
   instead of telling the computer, “list my files, please”, one writes
   a standard abbreviated command word—‘ls’. Typing ‘ls’ in a command
   shell is a script way of telling the computer to list your files.1

   The real flexibility of this approach is apparent only when you
   realize that there are many, many different ways to list files.
   Perhaps you want them sorted by name, sorted by date, in reverse
   order, or grouped by type. Most graphical browsers have simple ways
   to express this. But what about showing only a few files, or only
   files that meet a certain criteria? In very complex and specific
   situations, the request becomes too difficult to express using a
   mouse or pointing device. It is just these kinds of requests that are
   easily solved using a command shell.

..

   For example, what if you want to list every Word file on your hard
   drive, larger than 100 kilobytes in size, and which hasn’t been
   looked at in over six months? That is a good candidate list for
   deletion, when you go to clean up your hard drive. But have you ever
   tried asking your computer for such a list? There is no way to do it!
   At least, not without using a command shell.

   The role of a command shell is to give you more control over what
   your computer does for you. Not everyone needs this amount of
   control, and it does come at a cost: Learning the necessary script
   commands to express what you want done. A complicated query, such as
   the example above, takes time to learn. But if you find yourself
   using your computer frequently enough, it is more than worthwhile in
   the long run. Any tool you use often deserves the time spent learning
   to master it."

Remarks; - Under Windows, after having installed Git, you have access to
“git bash”, which provides a terminal with the bash shell and emulates
many unix commands. - Under Windows 10, Microsoft has recently made
available the “Windows Subsystem for Linux”, which provides a virtual
Linux system running inside Windows. (See
https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/, and
https://itsfoss.com/windows-linux-kernel-wsl-2/).

-  Under MacOSX, when you open a terminal, you may be interacting with
   the bash shell or the zsh shell (to know which, type
   ``echo $SHELL``).

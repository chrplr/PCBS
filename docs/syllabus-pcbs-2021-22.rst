Ateliers de Programmation pour les (Neuro)Sciences Cognitives /
Programming for Cognitive and Brain Sciences

**IMPORTANT: PCBS1 starts on November 9th 2021, 13h30, Salle FARABOEUF
(Rue des Saint Pères)**

This year (2021-2022) the lecture is split in 3 independent modules:

1. PROG Introduction to Programming with Python (first half of semester
   1)

   This series of lectures targets students with little or no prior
   knowledge of programming. It will introduce the fundamentals concepts
   of coding : variables, expressions, functions, control structures,
   input/ouput. The course will make use of https://pythontutor.com/

2. PCBS Programming for Cognitive and Brain Sciences (2 sessions: second
   half of semester 1 and first half of semester 2)

The purpose of this module is to train students to solve typical tasks
encountered in cognitive or neurosciences: (creation of stimuli,
programming of real-time experiments, data manipulation and analysis,
simulations…), using Python ou R. The course consists of short lectures
followed by hands-on exercises.

3. PROJ Programming project (second half of semester 2)

   Each student selects a cognitive science topic (psychology
   experiment, simulations of a cognitive system, etc, …) and implements
   it using a programming language. The project’s development should be
   public on github.

Aim:

to learn useful tools for cognitive science and implement some typical
activities of cognitive scientist:

Method: hands-on lecture (=TD). After 15~30 min of introduction, you are
given a series of excercices to perform.

\*\* Hopfield network

Read
https://towardsdatascience.com/hopfield-networks-are-useless-heres-why-you-should-learn-them-f0930ebeadcd
and do not look at the jupyter notebook implementation provided by the
author. Try to program a hopefield network and teach irt a few patterns.
Only then, check the author’s solution.

To go further you can read:

Course description
------------------


Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~

Students in Cognitive-(Neuro)-science need to learn programming:

1. to understand how computers work, because of the importance of the
   Computational Theory of Mind in Cognitive Science.
2. to automate the boring stuff (e.g. repetitive work on files, web
   scrapping,)
3. to do reproducible science: simulating models, designing experiments, running
   them, analysing data, ...


The purpose of the PCBS course is to make students able to write clean code in
order to solve the tasks that are typically encountered in cognitive or
neurosciences (data manipulation and analysis, creation of stimuli, programming
of real-time experiments, simulations...). The first half (6 weeks) of the
course consists of lectures with hands-on exercises, then, during the last 6
weeks, students have to realize a project publicly available on github.


Learning outcomes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    
On successful completion of this course, students should be able to write
readable, well- documented, Python programs, and use system such as git that
promote reproducible science.

                    
Pedagogy, class organization and homework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first classes are CM with hands-on exercices. The remaining classes, I and
the teaching assistant are present for individual support to help the students
accomplish their project. I also give weekly assignments to be done *before* the
next lecture.
                    
Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~

The projects will be graded on a 20 points scale. The main criterion is *clarity*
(see :ref:`projects` for more details).



Textbook and readings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the materials are available on the course’s web site at http://github.com/chrplr/PCBS.
                    

Course policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    
Laptops: Students must bring there own laptop (preferably fully charged!) with
the specified software preinstalled.
                    
Participation. You are strongly encouraged to participate in lectures and on the
slack discussion forum. The more advanced students are expected to help the
beginners.


Prerequisites
-------------

Students are expected to know how to open a terminal and `navigate in the file system <http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0020.php>`__ and to know how to view and edit text files with a text editor such as `Sublime Text <https://www.sublimetext.com>`__.

They should  acquainted with basic programming concepts: instructions, variables, tests (if..then..else), loops (while and for). Check out  starting-from-scratch_ or the pointers listed in resources_:

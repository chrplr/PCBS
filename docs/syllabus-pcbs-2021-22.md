Aim 
====

Learn  useful tools for cognitive science and implement some typical activities of cogntivie scientist:

Method: hands-on lecture (=TD). After 15~30 min of introduction, you are given a series of excercices to perform.


# Creating Visual stimuli with pygame

https://pcbs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running-experiments.html

# Programming simple reaction-time tasks with expyriment

# Manipulation of sound with Praat

* How is sound represented in hte computer. How can it be manipulated. See http://www.pallier.org/lectures/tpexp2/tp.html

* Programming an ABX sound experiment with epxyriment

# Search a lexical database with R / Learn about regular expressions

- https://github.com/chrplr/openlexicon/blob/master/documents/Interroger-Lexique-avec-R/interroger-lexique-avec-R.pdf

- https://pcbs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/regular_expressions.html

- Zipf law


# Numerical Simulations with numpy


## Statistics by simulations

* Permutation test and the concept of p-values.

* The issue of multiple comparisons

* Analyses of time-series



## Réseaux de neurones et/ou automate cellulaire

** Hopfield network

Read https://towardsdatascience.com/hopfield-networks-are-useless-heres-why-you-should-learn-them-f0930ebeadcd and do not look at the jupyter notebook implementation provided by the author. Try to program a hopefield network and teach irt a few patterns. Only then, check the author’s solution.

To go further you can read:

    Ramsauer, Hubert, Bernhard Schäfl, Johannes Lehner, Philipp Seidl, Michael Widrich, Thomas Adler, Lukas Gruber, et al. 2020. “Hopfield Networks Is All You Need.” ArXiv:2008.02217 [Cs, Stat**, December. http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217.

** Perceptron

    Read about the Percepton at https://medium.com/@thomascountz/perceptrons-in-neural-networks-dc41f3e4c1b9
    Implement a Perceptron in Python

For a solution, check : https://blog.dbrgn.ch/2013/3/26/perceptrons-in-python/


* Analyse de données neurales (spike trains).

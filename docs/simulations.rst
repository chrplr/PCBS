Monte Carlo Estimation
----------------------

-  Read about `Monte Carlo estimation of PI <https://academo.org/demos/estimating-pi-monte-carlo/>`__

-  Write a script that estimates the number 'pi' using this method.

- Compare it to my solution: :download:`simulations/estimate_PI_by_MonteCarlo.py <../simulations/estimate_PI_by_MonteCarlo.py>`)

Fractals
--------

`Fractals <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal>`__ are figures that
are self-similar at several scales.

-  Write a script that displays the `Koch snowflake <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake>`__

   Hints:

   -  use the turtle module
   -  use recursion

Formal systems
--------------

MU Puzzle
~~~~~~~~~

A famous seminal book in Cognitive Science is *Gödel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden* by Douglas Hofstadter. Its main topic is recursion and self-reference (see also *I am strange loop* by the same author).


According to Hofstadter, the formal system that underlies all mental activity transcends the system that supports it. If life can grow out of the formal chemical substrate of the cell, if consciousness can emerge out of a formal system of firing neurons, then so too will computers attain human intelligence. Gödel, Escher, Bach is a wonderful exploration of fascinating ideas at the heart of cognitive science: meaning, reduction, recursion, and much more (from https://medium.com/@alibedirhan.d/mu-puzzle-f651ef3957c5)

The book is filled with puzzles, including Hofstadter’s famous **MU puzzle**. The MU puzzle involves a simple formal system called **MIU**.

A starting string, ``MI``, is given. Four rules for changing the string of characters into a new one are provided (see below). A each step, the current string can be transformed into a new string by the application of one of the four rules. Note that rules are one-way!  In case there are several applicable rules, there is nothing that will dictate which rule you should use, it’s up to you! Here are the rules:


1. If you possess a string whose last letter is ``I``, you can add on a ``U`` at the end. For example ``MIUI`` can be rewritten ``MIUII``. This rule can be written ``xI -> xIU`` where ``x`` represents any string
   
2. Suppose you have ``Mx``. Then you may rewrite it ``Mxx``. For example, from ``MIU``, you may get ``MIUIU`` (x = ``IU`` therefore; ``Mxx = MIUIU``; From ``MUM``, you may get ``MUMUM``, From ``MU``, you may get ``MUU``, ...

3. If ``III`` occurs in one of the strings, you may make a new string with ``U`` in place of ``III``. For example, 
    From ``UMIIIMU``, you could make ``UMUMU``; From ``MIIII``, you could make ``MIU`` (also ``MUI``). From ``IIMII``, you can't get anywhere using this rule because the three ``I``'s have to be consecutive.


4. If ``UU`` occurs inside one of your strings, you can drop it. From ``UUU``, you get ``U``. From ``MUUUIII``, get ``MUIII``.


The **Mu Puzzle** asks whether starting from the string ``MI``, there exists a *derivation*, that is a sequence of aplications of the rules, that can yield the string ``MU``.

Exercice: Write a Python script that explores the set of strings generated by this formal system, to try and see if ``MU`` can be generated.

Then you may read :

- Ernest Nagel and James Newman's book `Gödel's Theorem <http://calculemus.org/cafe-aleph/raclog-arch/nagel-newman.pdf>`__ (translated into French : `Le théorème de Gödel <https://www.eyrolles.com/Sciences/Livre/le-theoreme-de-godel-9782020327787/>`__)


Natural Language Parsing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parsing refers to building the syntactic structure of a sentence from
the linear sequence of words that compose it.

* Read Chapter 12 (Constituency Grammars)  and 13 (Constituency Parsing)  of Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin's `Speech and Language Processing <https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/>`__
 
* Explore the `various parsing algorithms <http://www.nltk.org/book/ch08.html>`__\ using the `Natural Language Toolkit <https://www.nltk.org/>`__.


Cellular Automata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Learn about Conway’s `Game of
Life <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life>`__. Watch
`this <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-W0NX97DB0>`__ and
`that <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE>`__ videos.

-  Implement an `Elementary cellular
   automaton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton>`__.
   The aim is to reproduce the graphics shown at the bottom on the
   previous page. you can take inspiration from the excellent `Think
   Complexity <http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity-2e/>`__ by
   Allen B. Downey. My solution is at
   `cellular-automata/1d-ca.py <cellular-automata/1d-ca.py>`__.

-  Implement the Game of Life in 2D.

-  Going futher: If you enjoy Cellular Automata, you can read Stephen
   Wolfram’s `A New Kind of
   Science <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science>`__. A
   more general book about Complexity is Melanie Mitchell’s *Complexity:
   a guided tour*.




Artificial Neural networks
--------------------------

To understand the basics of artificial neural networks, I recommend that
you first read https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/ and
then watch the four excellent videos at
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi
. The last two of them focus on the backpropagation algorithm that allow
to train network to learn mapping.

Next, you can read and try to understand this
`implementation <https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2017/06/01/back-propagation.aspx>`__
of the backpropagation algorithm.

Then, see a modern and efficient implementation of neural networks:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_nlp_tutorial.html

Projects
========

The project should try to replicate an experiment or some simulations related to cognitive (neuro-) science.

An example of the kind of things that we expect is provided at http://chrplr.github.io/PCBS-LexicalDecision


- All documents (scripts, stimuli, documentation, data files) related to the project should be on a github.com repository with a name starts with ``PCBS-``  followed by a label that gives an idea of what the project is about.

- The main page of the repository (``README.md``) should :
    * describe the aim of the project (explain the experiment or the simulation 
    * explain how to install and run the experiment on one's computer (which command line, which options if any).
    * if the project involves analyses, the README.md should point to a documents (html, pdf, not Word!!!) containing the report.
    
- It is highly recommended to use the ‘Pages’ system of github to generate a nice looking page (see https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site ).

- It should be possible to clone your repository and execute your code without modifying anything. This implies that you should absolutely avoid absolute pathnames. Also your code must be portable and run on MacOS, Windows and Linux.

- Send us a link to your github project as soon as possible so that we can check your progress. 

- The readability of the code, and of the main page are of the main criteria of evaluation.

- Do not be overambitious: a well written project that does a simple thing but well will receive a better score than one that has an unreadble code that does complicated things.

-  You can work in binomes to read, check and criticize each other code
   regularily. it is very useful to have someone else check that the
   documentation and code that you write is readable.

-  use the slack forum https://cogmaster-pcbs.slack.com/ to ask questions

- At the end of the `README.md` file, you must include a section detailling:
    - your previous coding experience
    - what you have learned since then, by following the lecture, coding the project or working by yourself
    - what you missed in this course.

I have uploaded some experimental papers on the Schoology web size (in Materials: `papers-for-projects.zip`) that can be used as the basis of your project.

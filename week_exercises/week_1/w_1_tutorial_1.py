"""Tutorial: Using lists and dictionaries in Python"""

# Create a list with a literal

# Access an element in the list by index

# Access the last element in the list

# Get a part of the list by index slice

# Add an element at the end of the list

# Get the number of elements in the list

# Iterate over elements in the list

# Iterate over list indices

# Iterate over indices and elements in the list

# Create a list with a loop

# Create a list with a list comprehension

# Create a list with a list comprehension including a conditonal


# Create a dictionary with a literal

# Access a value by key in the dict

# Set a value by key in the dict for a new key

# Set a new value by key in the dict

# Iterate over keys in the dict

# Iterate over values in the dict

# Iterate over keys and values in the dict

# Create a dictionary with a loop

# Create a dictionary with a dict comprehension


# Test that order matters in list equality

# Test that order does not matter in dict equality

# Check that index is not out of range before accessing

# Check that key exists in the dict before accessing

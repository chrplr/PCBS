# Programming for Cognitive and Brain Sciences (PCBS) #

Students in cognitive (neuro)science need to:

1. understand how computers work, because of the importance of the
   Computational Theory of Mind in Cognitive Science.
2. automate the boring stuff (e.g.Â repetitive work on files, web
   scrapping,)
3. do reproducible science: simulating models, designing experiments, running
   them, analysing data, ...
   

The purpose of this course is to make students able to write clean code in
order to solve the tasks that are typically encountered in cognitive or
neurosciences (data manipulation and analysis, creation of stimuli, programming
of real-time experiments, simulations...).

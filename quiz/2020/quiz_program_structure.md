## Structure of Programs

**Note: There is only one correct answer per question.**

**What is a program?**

- [ ] Something you follow along at a play or concert
- [ ] A computation, even a symbolic computation
- [ ] A sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation
- [ ] An algorithm (program and algorithm are synonymous)

**What is the source code of a program?**

- [ ] The language that you are programming in (e.g. Python)
- [ ] The environment in which the program is executed
- [ ] The instructions in a program, stored in one or several files
- [ ] The sequence of binary numbers that the program takes as input


**Which of the following is a syntax error?**

- [ ] Attempting to divide by 0
- [ ] Forgetting to divide by 100 when calculating a percentage
- [ ] Forgetting a colon at the end of a statement where one is required

**Which of the following is a runtime error?**

- [ ] Attempting to divide by 0
- [ ] Forgetting to divide by 100 when calculating a percentage
- [ ] Forgetting a colon at the end of a statement where one is required

**Which of the following is a semantic error?**

**What is a function in Python?**

- [ ] A mathematical expression that calculates a value
- [ ] A statement of the form x = 5 + 4
- [ ] A named sequence of statements
- [ ] Any sequence of statements

**What is one main purpose of a function?**

- [ ] To improve the speed of execution
- [ ] To calculate values
- [ ] To help the programmer organize programs into chunks that match
      how they think about the solution to the problem

**What is a module in Python?**

- [ ] One line of code in a program
- [ ] A separate block of code
- [ ] A file that contains definitions and statements intended for use in other Python programs
- [ ] A file that contains documentation about functions in Python

**What determines the name of the module, which you must put after the `import` statement to use the module?**

- [ ] A line in the module that starts with special characters
- [ ] The first variable name in the module
- [ ] The comment at the top of the module
- [ ] The filename of the module

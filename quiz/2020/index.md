Once you are done, check your results and use the following guidelines to determine what to do during the upcoming classes.

- If you have any error\* in Quiz 1: Attend all the lectures.
- Else, if you have any error\* in Quiz 2 or 3: Attend the lectures starting from those corresponding to Chapter 2 of Sweigart's book "Automate the boring stuff"
- Else, if you have any error\* in Quiz 4: Attend the lectures starting from those corresponding to Chapter 3 of Sweigart's book "Automate the boring stuff".
- Else, if you have any error\* in Quiz 5: Just read page 7 and 8 of Sweigart's book "Automate the boring stuff" to get up to speed on these specific aspects of Python.
- Else, if you have any error\* in Quiz 6: We will clarify these notions after adressing Chapter 3. No need to attend the lectures until then.
- Else: Lucky you! No need to attend the lectures until we gather the whole class. We will suggest more advanced materials to work on based on your interests.

\*By "error" we mean a genuine error, not an error due to inattention that you are sure to understand why it is wrong and why the correct answer is the one it is.

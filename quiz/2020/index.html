<ul>
<li>If you have any error* in Quiz 1: Attend all the lectures.</li>
<li>Else, if you have any error* in Quiz 2 or 3: Attend the lectures starting from those corresponding to Chapter 2 of Sweigart’s book “Automate the boring stuff”</li>
<li>Else, if you have any error* in Quiz 4: Attend the lectures starting from those corresponding to Chapter 3 of Sweigart’s book “Automate the boring stuff”.</li>
<li>Else, if you have any error* in Quiz 5: Just read page 7 and 8 of Sweigart’s book “Automate the boring stuff” to get up to speed on these specific aspects of Python.</li>
<li>Else, if you have any error* in Quiz 6: We will clarify these notions after adressing Chapter 3. No need to attend the lectures until then.</li>
<li>Else: Lucky you! No need to attend the lectures until we gather the whole class. We will suggest more advanced materials to work on based on your interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>*By “error” we mean a genuine error, not an error due to inattention that you are sure to understand why it is wrong and why the correct answer is the one it is.</p>

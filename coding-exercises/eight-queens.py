"""Solver for the eight queens puzzle.

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8
chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires
that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

As there can be only one queen per column and per row, a winning solution can
be represented by a set of 8 numbers, one per line, which represent the column
in which there is a queen. Because the columns must be different, the solutions
are a subset of the permutations of 8 numbers. We just have to check that no
two queens are in the same diagonal.

The technique for checking the diagonals is to add or subtract the column
number from each entry, so any two entries on the same diagonal will have the
same value (in other words, the sum or difference is unique for each
diagnonal). Now all we have to do is make sure that the diagonals for each of
the eight queens are distinct. So, we put them in a set (which eliminates
duplicates) and check that the set length is eight (no duplicates were
removed).

Any permutation with non-overlapping diagonals is a solution. So, we print it
and continue checking other permutations.
